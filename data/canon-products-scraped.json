Thanks to its use of the small, light 8mm cassettes, the  VM-E1 had a light, compact body and outstanding operability and  functionality. Its design and body coloring gave it an active feel and  a high-class look.",

In  addition, an alternate model, the E53, was also developed for the North  American market. It retained the simple operation and high image  quality of the E50 while adding a high-speed shutter (1/1000 second)  that enabled users to shoot sharp video of rapidly moving subjects. The  E53 did not incorporate special playback functions such as fine slow  and single-frame playback.",

It incorporated a 20x optical  zoom lens and a built-in 0.65x wide attachment lens for ultrawide-angle  shooting, allowing users to take video images in places with  insufficient shooting distance. In addition, greater compactness was  achieved by placing the video recording section and lens section in  parallel.",

      "description": "To strengthen Canon’s lineup of 8mm video camcorders, the G1000 was developed especially for markets outside Japan.   Inheriting the basic features of its predecessor, the G1000 achieved a more compact size as well as a more powerful  system and simple operation. The newly developed compact and lightweight 22x optical  zoom lens made possible a radical reduction in size, while a built-in battery  charger and new lithium-ion battery also helped to raise the quality of the  power system while reducing its size. In addition, the Time Base Corrector realized  razor-sharp images during playback.",

When outfitted with a Canon EF lens, the C300’s peripheral illumination correction* automatically corrects for vignetting in accordance with each lens’s optical characteristics, and enables iris control from the camcorder.* Canon EF lenses also enable the recording of such metadata* as the name of the lens used, aperture setting and shutter speed.\nThe EOS C300 PL is equipped with a PL lens mount for use with industry-standard PL lenses.\nThe Canon EOS C300/C300 PL’s newly developed Super 35 mm-equivalent CMOS sensor incorporates approximately 8.29 million effective pixels and has a pixel size that is larger than that for conventional professional camcorders, enabling greater light-gathering capabilities for enhanced sensitivity and reduced noise. The sensor reads Full HD (1920 x 1080 pixels) video signals for each of the three RGB primary colors, decreasing the incidence of moiré while realizing high resolution with 1,000 horizontal TV lines.\nWith a compact body design measuring 133 (w) x 179 (h) x 171 mm (d), the Canon EOS C300/C300 PL delivers exceptional maneuverability, enabling shooting from vantage points all but inaccessible to large cinema cameras, such as close to the ground for high-impact low-angle shots, and alongside walls. In accordance with on-location shooting needs, the camcorder can be outfitted with a handle, grip, thumb rest and monitor unit, and offers an array of industry-standard terminals, including HD/SD-SDI video output for the external recording of high-quality video content.",

The cinema camera accommodates Canon’s diverse lineup of interchangeable EF lenses for EOS SLR cameras as well as new EF Cinema Lenses, which deliver imaging performance ideally suited for cinematic applications.\nIncorporating an industry-standard-size Super 35 mm-equivalent CMOS sensor (approximately 8.29 million effective pixels), the EOS C100 makes possible filmic expression such as images featuring attractive blur characteristics. Additionally, the large surface area of each pixel enables high light-gathering capabilities with high sensitivity and reduced noise. The EOS C100’s sensor reads Full HD (1920 x 1080 pixels) video signals for each of the three RGB primary colors, decreasing the incidence of moiré while realizing high resolution with 1,000 horizontal TV lines. Supported by a heightened signal read-out speed, the CMOS sensor reduces rolling shutter skews, a phenomenon prevalent with CMOS sensors in which fast-moving subjects may appear diagonally distorted.\nIn addition to Canon Log, the camera newly employs Wide DR Gamma, realizing a maximum 800% wide dynamic range. Assuming output to a television monitor, the feature does away with the need for post-production processes while realizing smooth gradation with reduced detail loss in highlight areas.\n\nThe EOS C100’s compact body design is approximately 15% less in volume and approximately 29% lighter in weight than the EOS C300/EOS C300 PL, enabling shooting in confined environments to make possible innovative possibilities in imaging expression. In accordance with on-location shooting needs, the camera can be outfitted with such unit accessories as a handle, grip, and thumb rest.\nEquipped with “Push Auto Iris” and “One-Shot AF” buttons, the EOS C100 enables one-touch automatic iris and focus adjustment. Additionally, when outfitted with the EF-S18-135mm f/3.5-5.6 IS STM (released in June 2012), a new function enabled the automatic continuous adjustment of focus and iris settings for subjects located in the center of the frame.",

      "description": "The EOS-1D C, a digital single-lens reflex (SLR) camera targeting the motion picture, television and other digital high-resolution production industries. Realizing outstanding video performance, the compact, lightweight EOS-1D C delivers 4K (4,096 x 2,160 pixels) video recording to support cutting-edge visual expression possibilities such as shots employing blur effects.\n\nThe Canon EOS-1D C is capable of recording video at 4K (at a frame rate of 24p, with 8-bit Motion JPEG compression), cropped to an APS-H-equivalent size angle of view, making possible next-generation visual expression with even higher image quality and resolution performance.\n\nThe camera is capable of recording video, including 4K, to an inserted CF card without using such peripheral equipment as external recorders, enabling workflows with increased mobility. In addition, captured video can be output from an HDMI terminal to an external recorder (excluding 4K video) using an uncompressed YCbCr 4:2:2 signal. The EOS-1D C also supports Full HD (1,920 x 1,080 pixels) video recording at a frame rate of 60p to satisfy the demands of professionals in the industry. Facilitating a smooth introduction into motion-picture production locations, the camera incorporates a Super 35 mm crop function allowing video to be recorded in the industry-standard 35 mm angle of view. Canon Log Gamma enables the recording of high-quality video with rich gradation expression, making possible the type of impressive image quality required in motion pictures by minimizing both shadow-detail loss and highlight-detail loss while providing a high level of color-grading freedom.\n\nEquipped with a 35 mm full-frame approximately 18.1-megapixel CMOS sensor, the EOS-1D C makes possible sublime imaging expression, such as beautiful image blur. Furthermore, when shooting video, the new camera features an expanded sensitivity range up to ISO25600 for exceptional visual imaging results with reduced noise even in low-light settings. By combining the new camera with one of Canon’s more than 60 interchangeable EF lenses or EF Cinema Lenses, which draw out the highest levels of performance from the company’s EOS-series camera lineup, professionals will be able to realize exceptional image quality with great expressive power.",

      "description": "The EOS C100 Mark II is the first Cinema EOS System camera to employ Canon’s DIGIC DV 4 imaging platform. Offering exceptional processing power, DIGIC DV 4 makes possible accurate color reproduction while minimizing the occurrence of moiré and “jaggies,” and delivers high-image-quality performance with reduced noise even when shooting in low-light conditions.\nSupporting exceptional basic performance, the EOS C100 Mark II’s Dual Pixel CMOS AF technology enables Continuous AF, a function that automatically maintains focus on a subject in the center of the frame when using a Canon interchangeable EF lens.*1 Additionally, the new HD video camera offers face detection AF*2 when paired with an EF lens equipped with STM (stepper motor) technology.*3  Incorporating a variety of advanced AF functions, the EOS C100 Mark II contributes to improved workflow efficiency during interviews and other shooting situations involving human subjects. Capable of recording in the AVCHD and MP4 file formats and supporting frame rates of 59.94/50.00 frames per second, the camera produces smooth, clear video images even when capturing fast-moving subjects. Furthermore, a slow-motion recording mode lets users slow down the action by up to 40%.\nFeaturing the same compact, lightweight body design as its predecessor, the new Canon EOS C100 Mark II supports a wide range of shooting styles and usage environments, including confined spaces, ushering in new possibilities in imaging expression. Additionally, it employs an OLED display that can be rotated horizontally up to approximately 270 degrees as well as a viewfinder that can be tilted upward at a maximum of 65 degrees for exceptional operability that delivers a level of shooting flexibility on par with that offered by the high-end cinema camera models from the Cinema EOS System series.",

      "description": "Delivering 4K-resolution video with exceptional image quality, the EOS C300 Mark II incorporates a Canon-developed Super 35mm-equivalent approximately 8.85-megapixel CMOS image sensor and the Company’s latest imaging platform, Dual DIGIC DV 5, which offers exceptional processing power. In addition to newly employing Canon Log 2, the Company’s proprietary gamma setting, the EOS C300 Mark II is equipped with Canon’s new XF-AVC video format to realize an expanded dynamic range compared with its predecessor. The cinema camera enables the preservation of image detail without overexposure or underexposure even in shooting environments that combine highly divergent lighting conditions, such as a dark interior with a window that looks out on to a brightly lit landscape.\n\nWhen shooting with an EF-series lens,* the EOS C300 Mark II’s Dual Pixel CMOS AF technology supports Continuous AF, which automatically maintains focus on a subject within a wide focusing area covering approximately 80% (vertical and horizontal) of the image display screen. The cinema camera is also equipped with a variety of advanced AF functions, including Face Detection AF, which can be utilized together with Continuous AF. Thanks to these features, the EOS C300 Mark II allows users to quickly make focus adjustments based on individual shooting styles, even when capturing 4K video which, due to its high level of resolution, requires a significant level of focusing accuracy.\n\nThe EOS C300 Mark II supports Canon’s new XF-AVC video format, which realizes a high data-compression rate without sacrificing image quality, facilitating the efficient recording of high-image-quality 4K, 2K and Full HD video footage to a CFast 2.0 or SD memory card. The new video format delivers enhanced workflows across various stages of the 4K-video production process, from shooting to editing.",

      "description": "The first prototype zoom lens was developed at Canon in the early 1950s, but it was not satisfactory for engineers. Then, a new zoom lens system was developed. It had two variable magnification lens groups, which were moved by independent cams. Moreover, it was the first zoom lens with an epoch-making 4x zoom and the fastest f/1.4 lens speed at the time. This lens was developed by Dr. Keizo Yamaji, who later became the president of Canon Inc., and so this kind of lens design was called the “Yamaji type.” It became the most popular zoom lens type for movie cameras.\n\nThe body of the Zoom 8 was common with the 8-T but the Zoom 8 was equipped with this zoom lens. Although it was based on the 8-T, this camera had a single-lens reflex viewfinder with a split-image rangefinder and electric exposure meter. This was the first Canon movie camera equipped with a zoom lens, and it became very popular. It also had a detachable trigger grip.",

      "description": "The performance of batteries improved significantly around 1959, and batteries with stable performance became available in the market. At the same time, Canon was developing a micro-motor. This is how development of a movie camera with better operability, the core feature of these cameras, started. Instead of a conventional spring motor, it applied an electric motor that could drive film continuously much longer than a spring motor, fully using battery capability. Zooming was performed electrically, as was exposure control, which was called EE, or Electric Eye (AE, or Automatic Exposure today). These were major factors for a very compact movie camera design. Because of its three electric functions, it was named the “EEE”.\n\nThe lens was a newly developed 4x f/1.7 zoom lens. Aperture control with two outside levers made EE, manual exposure and fading operation easy. A film rewind crank was applied at the same time. As a result, this camera became suitable for both beginners and advanced amateurs.",

      "description": "In April 1964, Eastman Kodak announced a new 8mm film standard: Super 8. This standard had a larger image size than regular 8, and the film was contained in an easy-to-handle cartridge. The new standard severely impacted other manufacturers. Sales of regular 8-type 8mm cameras in the market dropped drastically, and development of regular 8 cameras was cancelled immediately, even for models nearly completed.\n\nCanon developed its first Super 8 model: the Zoom 518 Super 8. This camera was the first movie camera to use ABS on its exterior, which later became standard. The zoom lens was the same as that of the Cine Zoom 512, marketed in June 1964, except for the rear group, which was newly developed to adapt to the Super 8 format. This was also the first movie camera to employ the TTL (Through-The-Lens) system for light measuring.",

The lens was newly developed, and the prism screen rangefinder in the viewfinder was omitted. Instead, a “zone focus mark” was added on the lens barrel to enable guess focusing.\n\nLeather-grained plastic bordered by chromed metal created an advanced design, which, along with the slim body, made this a long-selling model.

The film format was the same as the Kodak Super 8, but the shape of the cartridge was quite different. The Kodak Super 8 system had the largest share of the global market, but Single 8 models were developed mainly for the Japanese market. Maximized parts reuse from Super 8 models to Single 8 models was studied at the R&D stage. The cartridge-loading methods of Super 8 and Single 8 systems were symmetrical. For this reason, designing a reversed Super 8 model as a Single 8 model was once studied. Actually, a test model with the viewfinder on underside of the camera, was produced, but it was not easy to handle, and this idea was abandoned.\n\nThis model had the same specifications as the Zoom 518 Super 8 (marketed in 1964), but it had a very stiff design with a battery compartment on the die-cast exterior and a fixed grip. This camera had a rewinding crank, which was unique to the Single 8 system, and it was accepted by many 8mm movie camera lovers.",

      "description": "The Super 8 system had a film pressure plate inside the cartridge, which was unsuitable for high-end cameras. At the beginning, Eastman Kodak did not guarantee a fast lens speed, such as f/1.4. This model was developed to achieve a high-end camera for the Super 8 system. At the beginning, a 6x zoom lens was planned to be attached to this model, but Canon cleared numerous technological hurdles to apply higher magnification with a high-speed zoom lens. These hurdles included a film-driving technology within the allowance of depth of field by a fast f/1.4 lens, focusing and color reproduction for the Super 8 system, which had mainly tungsten films that always required CCA filters during the daytime. Finally, the Auto Zoom 814 Super 8, which had the world first 8x f/1.4 zoom lens, was introduced to the market.\n\nThe all metal mechanical design, with a carrying handle on top, in addition to high performance, made this camera very popular among many 8mm movie camera lovers.",

Automatic design using a computer reached the level for actual design work around this time, and Canon used it for the first time for development of this lens. This new technology could  achieve a compact and comparatively affordable 12x f/1.8 zoom lens with 19 elements in 13 groups for 8mm movie cameras. A “multi-layer coating” was applied for the first time on an 8mm movie lens, and it could supply high-contrast images.\n\nThe body was based on the Zoom 518, but two AA batteries and a mercury cell compartment were added at the side of the die-cast exterior. A detachable grip was also available.",

Canon  met the technical challenge to apply engineering plastic as much as possible. Plastic was used for the chassis and exterior, and even for  the lens barrel.\n\nThis was a compact, low-priced and easy-to-handle model applying drop-in film cartridge loading from the back of the camera and a compact fixed grip.\n\nAlso the FOCUS-MATIC model was marketed for exports, with an adapter to measure subject distance by aiming at the foot of the subject using triangular surveying theory.",

However, it could not satisfy requirements from professional photographers, who demanded Kodachrome film for conventional regular 8. Kodak introduced double-width 100-ft. (200-ft. for back and forth) Super 8 film on a reel for professional use under the name DS-8.\n\nThe Zoom DS-8, developed to adapt to this new film, used the outer design of the 16mm Canon Scoopic camera for journalistic use, which had an ideal human-engineering design. This model had the shape of the Scoopic, but the contents were totally new. Film transportation with sprockets, variable shutter opening angle, Servo EE were applied to this model, achieving a serious 8mm movie camera with full specifications and high durability for use in the media, academic and industrial fields.\n\nThe zoom lens was based on that of the Auto Zoom 814 Super 8 marketed in 1967.",

      "description": "We received a request from the NHK Technical Research Laboratory to develop a 16 mm movie camera equipped with a simultaneous sound recording mechanism. This is the first 16 mm movie camera in Japan equipped with a simultaneous sound recording mechanism that we commercialized after various product testing in many locations.\nWe started research in 1963 and commercialized this movie camera in 1970 after camera field tests had been performed by NHK cameramen and by a South Pole research and observation team.\n\nThat same year a mountain climbing team that reached the summit of Mt. Everest praised the camera as the only piece of equipment taken on the climb that was without even one defect.\n\nThe main mechanism of the Scoopic 16 was a magnetic head that recorded sound on 100 feet of magnetically coated film reeled around a sound drum inside the camera. A sound amplifier, a separate mechanism carried on the shoulder, was connected to the camera by a cable. For light to be guided to a view finder, the Sound Scoopic 100 adopted the mirror shutter with no loss of light whereas the Scoopic 16 that was launched in 1965 used a half-mirror. The EE mechanism also employed the TTL light metering method that guided the light to the CdS photocell through the half-mirror.",

      "description": "This was the first Canon movie camera to employ a “magnetic release.” The first electronics applied to movie  cameras were electronic motors for film drive and zooming, and EE (exposure control) mechanisms. With the introduction of the magnetic  release mechanism, however, electronics gradually came into full use. The magnetic release mechanism allowed the systemization of release operation and the control of camera on/off by electronic pulses. The magnetic release system became standard in 8mm movie cameras from this  model onward.\n\nThe popular 8x zoom lens was newly designed to provide higher contrast. It had a bright viewfinder and Servo EE system. It also had variable shutter opening control to achieve perfect fading out/in. Slow-motion shooting was possible at about 40 fps.\n\nA folding-type grip was employed, and an interval timer was available as an accessory.",

It was the Super 8 version of the  AUTO PROJECTOR 8Z, Canon’s high-end Regular 8 projector.\n\nLip-sync projection, a major requirement of advanced amateurs, was achieved by electronic motor control using signals from a tape recorder. The light source was a  high-efficiency tungsten-halogen lamp. Combined with the newly developed PS 17-28mm f/1.0 zoom lens, the lamp delivered highly improved large-size projection. This model was very well accepted as  the top-end projector.",

      "description": "The Sound Scoopic 100 and the Sound Scoopic 200 that were released in 1970 were well accepted by the market as movie cameras with the high capacity 6:1 zoom lenses. But there were calls for a camera with a lens of greater light gathering capability.\n\nThe answer to these calls was the Sound Scoopic 200S with a brighter, new lens (17 elements in 13 groups) and F-stops in the range 2.5 to 1.8. The upgrade was achieved by widening the shutter open angle from 135 to 170 degrees. The Sound Scoopic 200SE was also developed with TV image frame lines added inside the viewfinder.",

      "description": "A prototype of the Canon Auto Zoom 2018 movie camera was exhibited in 1970 at Photokina in Germany. In principle, it was impossible to rewind Super 8 film further than 90 frames. Canon used this characteristic to develop an overlap system comprising a rewind system and variable shutter mechanism. This overlap  system was applied in the Auto Zoom 1014 Electronic, which was actually  marketed later.\n\nBoth higher zooming magnification and lens compactness were pursued. Finally, a 10x f/1.4 zoom lens was realized with a filter diameter of 58 mm, applying a new zooming mechanism. In this lens, the second lens group with negative power and the third lens group with positive power moved to opposite sides. This zooming method became Canon’s standard and was very effective for high magnification zoom lenses. This model had slow motion shooting at 54 fps and also achieved unmanned shooting, such as continuous single frame shooting, using a magnet release function together with the Interval Timer E accessory or the Time Lapse Programmer, which was available by special order.",

      "description": "Eastman Kodak Company announced its XL system in 1971. This system improved part of the camera mechanism to increase the volume of the light reaching the film surface. It also made it possible to shoot under dim light conditions with high-speed film. “XL” stood for “Existing Light.” Canon developed a new XL shutter mechanism with a 220-degree shutter opening and low noise, as well as a new 5x f/1.2 zoom lens, which was considered the highest performance lens, even at the full opening, for the XL system at that time.\n\nMacro shooting as close as 5 cm from the lens top with the wide macro setting was also possible. The viewfinder became brighter and more precise. The exterior was changed from the traditional metallic image to black. A rubber foldable lens hood was attached at the lens top. From this model onward, all Canon 8mm movie cameras were XL type.",

Macro shooting at both the wide-angle and telephoto ends was made possible. A self-timer mechanism was built into the camera to enable 10 seconds shooting with 10 seconds delay. The power source, using mere two AA batteries, was located on top of the camera, and the compact folding-type grip was folded to the bottom of the camera. This layout renewal achieved a body only 39 mm wide. The extensive use of plastic resulted in a light weight of 620 grams, including batteries, but it also had a high-grade black body.\nA unique accessory for this model was a wide attachment lens for super wide-angle shooting at the wide-angle end of the lens.",

Eastman Kodak Company introduced its “Ektasound” magnetic recording system, which was built into the extended bottom part of the Super 8 cartridge. CHINON Industries Inc. also produced a sound camera that sold very well. Sales of high-end silent movie cameras dropped significantly from this point in time.\n\nWhen the development of a sound movie camera started, Canon sought for compactness, as other sound cameras were quite large. Finally, Canon successfully developed a compact sound movie camera, installing the sound mechanism in the extended part of the 514XL base body. Although this was a compact model, the sound system was very sophisticated, with audio level control and tone select functions. It had an impressive design including a new folding-type grip containing AA batteries. It became a long-selling hit.",

      "description": "This high-end movie camera responded to demands from many movie lovers. Based on the Auto Zoom 814 Electronic, which sold extremely well in the five years since its introduction, it added the XL function and a film and sound tape synchronized double sound recording system. Its unique shutter opening system had a 220-degree shutter opening for XL shooting, 150 degrees for normal shooting and variable opening control for fading. The lens of the Auto Zoom 814 was improved for better performance, and even one-step smaller aperture was realized. The viewfinder was also improved, adding brightness and precision, to suit XL shooting under dim light conditions. The viewfinder had two times the brightness and more than two times the focusing accuracy of split-image rangefinder of the Auto Zoom 814XL. The sound recording jack was built into the body to enable synchronized sound recording on a tape recorder, generating one pulse signal per frame. An optional synchronization unit attached to this jack and coupled with a tape recorder synchronized recording of the images and the sound became possible.",

Designers focused on compactness and light weight on a par with silent projectors, as well as easy operation.\n\nUnlike conventional projectors, this model had no reel arm, so was highly portable and easy to operate yet could accommodate a 400-foot reel. An automatic sound-level control circuit (ALC) was built in to allow recording at suitable sound level. The long-life, tungsten-halogen lamp with cold mirror coating, combined with the fast f/1.3 zoom lens, provided bright projection.\n\nA unique accessory to this model was the Daylight Viewer DV-1, a small screen attached in front of the lens for viewing images.",

      "description": "The Canon Systema Sound 16 movie camera, designed for but not limited to news reportage and suited to a wide range of other uses, was a premiere system camera in that it was a compilation of the features of past Canon 16 mm movie cameras. The shoulder held Systema Sound 16 was the only 16 mm sound movie camera in the world that allowed single and dual sound recording. A main characteristic of this camera was the mounting of the sound recording head on the main body of the camera, not attached to a magazine as with other cameras. The lens, film magazine, batteries, and recording amplifier, as well as the interchangeable 200-ft. and 400-ft. film magazines, could all be detached and reattached quickly. A new lens with an reflex mount was adopted with its design based on that of the Scoopic 200S10 released in 1972.\n\nAs the developments of news broadcasting technologies continued apace, mainly in the miniaturization of TV cameras with increased capabilities, and as news gathering systems were transitioning from silver-halide film to analog video, the Systema Sound 16 was the last of the line of Canon 16 mm movie cameras.",

      "description": "As 8mm movie cameras became increasingly computerized, this model became the world’s first 8mm movie camera to use a one-chip CPU. The CPU allowed electronic sequence control of the camera. The lens, a newly developed zoom lens with a wider-angle orientation, achieved both high performance and compactness. The world’s first superimposed viewfinder display showed superimposed information in the viewfinder only when necessary. Multiple functions and safety mechanisms, such as automatic lap dissolve or interval shooting, were applied to satisfy the needs of advanced amateurs. SPC (Silicon Photo Cell) was used for the photocell and it, together with a five-blade iris diaphragm, produced highly precise images with beautiful bokeh (pleasing out-of-focus highlights). This model could be called “the pinnacle of Canon 8mm movie cameras.”\n\nThe design stressed the mechanical, with an all-metal folding-type grip. It was very well accepted as a high end 8mm movie camera.",

A new system of using one actuator for film transport and auto-focus was developed, since this model first focused on the subject with near infrared active one-shot AF, and then started shooting. The lens used the same optical system as the long-selling 310XL marketed in 1975, but the lens barrel was modified to add an AF system.\nIt had an innovative design based on two-tone colors of dark gray and metallic silver, and a covered that completely enclosed the camera. Moreover, it had two AF windows, located above and below the lens, and a folding-type grip at the front of the camera. It achieved the world’s lightest weight (at that time) of 590 grams.",

The weight of the AF310XL-S was only 820 grams, making it the lightest AF sound movie camera in the world at that time.\n\nBoth the AF 310XL and the AF310XL-S had very complicated mechanisms, which caused delays before product introduction. As a result, video camcorders and portable CVC system video recorders, considered the new generation of motion picture recording tools, were marketed earlier. These two models were expected to revitalize sales of movie cameras, but they fell short of this goal and became the last Canon movie cameras.",

      "description": "The VC-20 boasts excellent operability that makes sophisticated techniques easy for anyone. This is achieved with an exclusive built-in filter that enables auto white balancing anywhere with touch-of-a-button fine tuning, as well as a video control feature whereby the basic video recorder functions can be operated from the camera.\nWith an 8x zoom lens built in and an advanced level of computer simulation incorporated right at the design stage, the model achieves a high degree of magnification as well as excellent contrast without distortion, all in a compact design. With a focal length ranging from a wide angle of 10mm to a telephoto of 80mm, plus a macro mechanism that enables the user to approach the subject up to a distance of just 4mm from the tip of the lens, it can be used in a variety of different shooting conditions depending on objective. The zoom system utilizes an electric power system. The zoom speed is continuously variable from low to high speed during shooting, for smooth zooming anywhere, anytime.\nIn addition to being parallax-free, which means that, even in cases where the distance between subject and shooter fluctuates, the lens optical axis and ranging position remain constant, this model also features accurate ranging free of problems caused by brightness or contrast with Canon’s own built-in active auto-focus mechanism, which utilizes near-infrared light. The result is auto-focus shooting that fully utilizes the advantages of our new high-power zoom lens and our highly sensitive image pickup tube, enabling the user to concentrate on shooting instead of focusing.\nThe image pickup tube utilizes a 2/3″ five-mega saticon tube that boosts color variation frequency up to 5MHz. This image pickup tube not only clears a horizontal resolution of more than 300 lines, but also produces superb color reproduction, achieving vivid-tone, high-definition image quality. With the combination of a high-performance lens and auto focus mechanism, it also makes shooting possible in low light of 1.5-lux.\nUtilizing a microcomputer, the VC-20 allows the user to choose between white, green, or orange lettering for title, stopwatch, and date displays with the multicolor superimpose function. In addition to the option of superimpose display combinations (the title and stopwatch or title and date), the display character size can be reduced and the position altered. Titles can also be stored in the memory for up to 24 hours.\nUsed in combination with the Portable Video Recorder VR-20, the user can check footage up to two seconds prior to the end of the shoot with the electric viewfinder. This is called the Rec. review function.",

      "description": "This color video camera has been developed and manufactured independently by Canon. This model offers high definition in a small, lightweight design. It is an example of superior operability, pursuing an ideal design based on the science of ergonomics, with features such as a side grip complete with a finger rest, and a special shape and positioning for easy operation that help eliminate error.\nThis model incorporates our very own active TTL/auto-focus system, where the subject is lighted up with near-infrared light through the lens, enabling ranging by the reflected light, and the lens optical axis and ranging position remain constant even if the distance between the subject and shooter fluctuates (parallax-free). The result is high-precision auto focusing unaffected by either brightness or contrast.\nThis model features a large caliber of f/1.2 brightness along with a 6x zoom lens packed into a compact size. Extensive computer simulation was carried out right at the design stage, achieving both large caliber and large magnification. It also has excellent distortion-free contrast, and the user can approach the subject at a distance of up to just 4mm from the tip of the lens thanks to the macro mechanism. With a teleconverter that enables a 1.4x magnification of the focus distance for telephoto shooting, this model makes high definition images possible under a variety of different conditions.\nThe image pickup tube utilizes a 1/2″ high band saticon tube that boosts color variation frequency up to 3.9MHz. It features not only superior color reproduction, but also achieves vivid-tone high-definition images with minimal lag.\nA variety of information including VTR battery levels, as well as operating conditions of the camera such as recording, exposure level, white balance, back light correction, and zoom speed are all displayed in easy-to-read characters in the viewfinder.\nThe model is also full of features that enable just about any user to employ sophisticated technique with ease, including the superimpose function that allows titles and the stopwatch display to be superimposed on images, an exclusive built-in filter that enables auto white balancing anywhere with touch-of-a-button fine tuning, and a remote control function that facilitates zooming and mid-shoot starting and stopping from distant positions.",

      "description": "Featuring the same ultra-compact, stylish body design as the best- selling IXY (rhymes with Dixie) lineup of Advanced Photo System cameras and packed with a range of advanced shooting functions, the new IXY DIGITAL represents a new generation of digital camera. The model, combining convenience, ease of use and a look that makes a distinct fashion statement, offers wide appeal to a wide range of users, positioning it to create an entirely new digital camera market.\n\nMeasuring 87 (w) x 57 (h) x 26.9 (d) mm, Canon’s new IXY DIGITAL incorporates the latest downsizing technologies to achieve a compact body approximately the same size as that of the Advanced Photo System IXY 320 camera, launched in March 1999. These include 2x zoom lens optics which, when the lens is in its retracted position, can be contained within a diameter of 20mm, the size of a 1-yen coin, and a thin LCD unit equipped with a white LED to provide backlighting. The model’s stylish compact design, featuring an elegant SUS316 stainless steel exterior, permits the camera to fit easily into a shirt pocket or slim briefcase.\nA 2.11 million-pixel 1/2.7″ CCD sensor and newly developed 35-70mm (35mm camera equivalent) 2x zoom lens incorporating three aspherical lens elements deliver sharp images with minimized distortion. Three- point AiAF, employing three active focusing points, enables the camera to automatically determine the primary subject, even if it is off- center, and focus accordingly while the perfectly round aperture produces natural-looking background blur. These innovations provide users with greater freedom of expression in a wide range of shooting situations, from casual snapshots of friends to artistic natural scenery.\nA Canon proprietary digital signal-processing IC makes possible fast, high-precision response that, working in tandem with the camera’s buffer memory, enables a shutter release time lag of just approximately 0.05 seconds and a shooting interval of a mere approximately 1.7 seconds for virtually stress-free picture taking. Contributing further to the IXY DIGITAL’s ease of use, the electrical and mechanical configurations employed in the model enable the LCD monitor on the back of the camera to provide 100% coverage. In other words, the image shown on the monitor shows the entire image that is captured, which means even first-time users can take the pictures they want.\nImage data is stored on CompactFlash™ cards, permitting the storage of up to approximately 46 images on a single 8MB card when shooting in the “Fine/Small” mode. The model ships with one 8MB CompactFlash card.",

      "description": "The PowerShot S300 Digital ELPH is Canon’s second ultra-compact digital camera. In addition to its high-resolution, and retractable 3x zoom lens, the S300 offers a number of new and improved features including: direct print capabilities from the new Canon Card Photo Printer CP-10; 20 frame-per-second movie clips with audio at selectable resolutions up to 640×480 pixels; shutter speeds from 1 second to 1/1500 second; an adaptive primary color filter for improved color reproduction; a choice of nine image quality modes; automatic exposure sensitivity adjustment; a high-output light guide flash; and a new high-speed digital signal processing IC with low power consumption.\nA new digital signal processing IC in the PowerShot S300 enables high-speed image processing and rapid data transfer through the cameras’ USB interface. The PowerShot S300 takes advantage of this feature by offering a Direct Print mode that enables users to print hard-copy images using Canon’s new CP-10 dye-sublimation printer. The CP-10 makes printing from digital files simple and fun by allowing users to control all print settings directly from the camera’s LCD monitor. Printer data is then transferred to the CP-10 directly through a dedicated interface cable. The new, ultra-compact printer produces beautiful, 300 x 300 dpi credit card-sized color prints in as little as 56 seconds. The CP-10 can also be used to print eight miniature copies of the same image on one sticker sheet, adding a new dimension of fun for everyone. Each sticker measures approximately 0.9″ x 0.7″.\nThe Canon PowerShot S300 can record movie clips with audio at 20 frames per second in any of three resolution modes: 640×480, 320×240 or 160×120. PowerShot S300 movie clips are recorded as QuickTime AVI files, with the image data saved in the Motion JPEG format and the sound in the WAVE format. The video portion of the PowerShot S300 movies can be replayed on the camera’s LCD monitor. Full audio-video playback is possible with a connected TV monitor or a compatible PC after downloading. Downloaded movie clips can be edited, saved, and sent to others via e-mail using the PowerShot S300’s bundled software.\nThe elegant stainless-steel body styling of the PowerShot S300 is based on the popular PowerShot S100, but the S300 features a new 3X (equivalent to 35-105mm in the 35mm format) f/2.7-4.7 lens including aspherical lens elements. The body dimensions and weight of the S300 are slightly larger than the S100 at 3.7 x 2.5 x 1.2″ and 8.5 ounces, but the PowerShot S300 is still the world’s smallest 2.1 megapixel digital camera with a 3X zoom lens. The Digital ELPH features a 0.37″, 2.1 megapixel CCD sensor that creates full color or black-and-white images up to 1600×1200 pixels when set to the camera’s Large mode. The camera also offers an additional settings of 1024×768 and 640×480 when set in the Middle or Small modes, which are ideal for on-screen applications, such as Web sites and CD-ROMs and allow more images to be recorded on a single CompactFlash memory card. The new camera is compatible with Type I CompactFlash Cards and will be shipped with an 8MB CF card.\nBundled with a comprehensive suite of programs enabling image management, editing, compositing and printing, the PowerShot S300 comes with ArcSoft PhotoImpression and VideoImpression software plus Apple QuickTime 4.1, Canon RemoteCapture 1.3, and PhotoStitch 3.1 for both Macintosh and Windows, as well as Canon ZoomBrowser EX 2.6, PhotoRecord 1.2 and WIA and TWAIN for Windows, plus ImageBrowser 1.6 and a Photoshop-compatible plug-in for the Mac. Features integrated in both ZoomBrowser EX 2.6 and ImageBrowser 1.6 include TimeTunnel and SlideShowMaker. When using ZoomBrowser EX 2.6 or ImageBrowser 1.6, users can take advantage of new and improved features for auto layout printing, self-running full-screen slide shows, and automated preparation of images for use as e-mail attachments. ZoomBrowser EX and Image Browser simplifies the process of emailing photos by automatically compressing the image and starting the email program.",

Fitted with a sliding lens cover, the digital cameras realize a compact, capsule-shaped body with a 1:2 height to length ratio. The PowerShot S40’s chic graphite-gray metallic finish exterior combine with the models’ sleek body design to deliver an eye-catching aesthetic appeal.\nPowerShot S40 incorporate advanced optical technology to deliver outstanding image quality. PowerShot S40 features the 4 megapixel CCD sensor and an RGB primary color filter, which enable rich, detailed images and lifelike color reproduction. Also, Canon’s newly developed high-speed “imaging engine” signal processor achieves a high signal to noise ratio to produce high-resolution images with natural color reproduction.\nWhile ably catering to the needs of first-timers with a range of automatic functions, PowerShot S40 also offer a variety of manual operating settings to satisfy the creative shooting needs of intermediate and advanced level users. Great shooting flexibility, from scenery to close-up snaps, is also realized by the compact size 3X zoom lens, which achieves a broad focal range equivalent to 35-105mm on a conventional 35mm camera.\nThe PowerShot S40 come enabled for the latest printing solution, direct-connect printing from the optional new BJ F890PD, and the Card Photo Printer CP-10.",

      "description": "The PowerShot A200 joins the A-series lineup one rank above the A100 released in April and features a newly developed bright 5mm (equivalent to 39mm in 35mm format) f/2.8 single-focal-length autofocus lens and a 1/3.2″ 2-megapixel CCD sensor for high image resolution. Maximizing utility for beginner users, the new A200 offers a large easy-to-use cross-configured control layout, readily understandable menu displays and a “one click”lens cover to make digital photography as easy as point and shoot.\n\nThe PowerShot A200 backs simplicity with advanced imaging technology found in high-end PowerShot models. An RGB primary color filter and Canon’s proprietary high-speed Imaging Engine digital signal-processing IC combine to realize a high signal-to-noise ratio, detailed images and faithful color reproduction. The A200 also features an all-glass lens incorporating five elements in five groups, including one highly refractive, glass-molded aspherical element that effectively suppresses distortion and maximizes the image-resolution potential of the CCD.\nThe PowerShot A200 also supports the Exif 2.2 (Exif Print) standard, which allows information important to the print process – such as camera settings, exposure time and white balance – to be stored with the image file as each photo is taken, enabling rich image reproduction.",

Newly added features include: Active Frame Control, which enables the AF/AE frame to be shifted within the viewfinder to the desired position without having to reposition the shot; Second-Curtain Flash Sync, which fires the flash at the end of the exposure, allowing streaks of light to flow naturally behind the movement of the subject when shooting in Slow Synchro Mode; and an internal ND (neutral density) filter, which decreases the amount of light passing through the lens to enable the use of slower shutter speeds, or wider apertures, in bright conditions to achieve background blur and slow-sync effects.\nMoreover, the PowerShot G3 newly features two Custom Modes on its easy-to-use mode dial, enabling users to freely program their favorite settings for instant access when needed, as well as an electronic dial to adjust aperture, shutter speed and exposure compensation, located conveniently on the top of the handgrip.",

      "description": "The PowerShot G5, which succeeds the 4-megapixel PowerShot G3 released in November 2002, combines the high performance and versatility of its predecessor with a high-resolution 1/1.8″ 5-megapixel CCD sensor, which realizes large images of up to 2,592 x 1,944 pixels for enhanced imaging performance.\nCanon’s proprietary DIGIC Image Processor optimizes the performance of the 5-megapixel CCD sensor to achieve image quality at the highest level in its class. Specialized for digital cameras, DIGIC architecture uses an enhanced signal-processing algorithm to enable processing power far greater than that of conventional technology. Executing large-volume, complex calculations in a split second, DIGIC realizes boosted image quality, auto-focus precision, and image-processing speed.\nThe PowerShot G5 also utilizes iSAPS technology to improve not only focus speed and accuracy, but also exposure and white-balance performance. Using Photographic Space information drawn from a database of thousands of photos, iSAPS technology allows the camera to pre-analyze each scene for faster auto-focusing and more precise auto-exposure and auto-white-balance performance than ever before.\nMoreover, Canon’s Intelligent Orientation Sensor automatically detects whether a picture is being taken horizontally or vertically, and adjusts the auto-focus, auto-exposure and auto-white-balance accordingly to ensure optimum results regardless of the orientation. The sensor also automatically orients the image correctly for previewing on the camera’s LCD screen or a PC monitor.\nThe PowerShot G5 caters to the varied needs of both advanced amateurs and semi-professionals with an extensive range of high-end photo features, including FlexiZone AF/AE, which allows users to shift the AF/AE frame freely within the viewfinder to focus on off-center subjects without having to reposition the shot; and AE and Focus Bracketing, enabling the selection of bracket ranges up to two full stops from the normal setting in 1/3-stop increments to ensure that the desired effect is achieved.\nMoreover, Second-Curtain Sync, which fires the flash at the end of the exposure, allows streaks of light to flow naturally behind the movement of the subject when shooting in Slow Synchro Mode. An internal ND (neutral density) filter decreases the amount of light passing through the lens to enable the use of slower shutter speeds, or wider apertures, in bright conditions to achieve background blur and slow-sync effects.\nMatching performance with style, the G5 features a lightweight highly durable aluminum cover finished in black Alumite for a striking appearance befitting the flagship model.",

      "description": "The Canon PowerShot A80 couples the ease of use and convenience of the PowerShot A series with a host of advanced features usually found in high-end models. As a result, the camera responds flexibly to user demands for not only fully automatic operation, but also shooting sophistication.\nThe PowerShot A80 incorporates in a compact metal body a high-resolution 1/1.8″ 4.0-megapixel CCD that captures images up to 2,272 x 1,704 pixels with exceptional detail and color fidelity. Further contributing to outstanding image quality is a newly designed 3x optical zoom lens (equivalent to 38-114 mm in 35 mm format). While making possible a wide shooting range – from snaps to landscapes – as well as compatibility with the large 4.0-megapixel sensor size, the compact lens features several design innovations that have permitted an overall reduction in the thickness of the camera without forsaking image quality.\nFor the first time in the PowerShot A series, the new A80 incorporates a Vari-Angle LCD monitor. Usually found on Canon’s high-end PowerShot G-series models, the Vari-Angle LCD monitor can be rotated through a horizontal arc of 180 degrees and a vertical arc of 270 degrees for easy framing, or folded away for protection when not in use. Other high-end features include: 9-point AiAF with selectable single center-point focus for accurate auto-focusing with unrestricted framing regardless of the position of the subject within the viewfinder; a large Shooting Mode Dial with 14 settings, including two newly added programmable Custom Modes; and Canon’s SI (Super Intelligent) sensor, which automatically detects the camera’s orientation, ensures optimum auto-focus, auto-exposure and auto-white-balance performance when used in the vertical position, and automatically orients the image correctly for previewing.",

      "description": "The Canon PowerShot Pro1 is the new flagship model in Canon’s PowerShot series of compact digital cameras. Offering the most advanced specifications in the series, the Pro1 features an eight-megapixel CCD image sensor for class-leading resolution, and a built-in Canon L (Luxury) Lens which, renowned in the company’s EF-series lineup of interchangeable lenses for EOS AF SLR cameras, delivers superlative image quality.\nMaximizing the benefit of the image sensor’s eight-megapixel resolution, the PowerShot Pro1’s L Lens marks a world first for a compact digital camera with the inclusion of a fluorite lens element, in addition to UD (ultra-low dispersion) and aspherical lens elements. As a result the L Lens effectively corrects for a variety of aberrations, including secondary spectrum (residual chromatic aberration), for exceptional image quality throughout the zoom range. Though compact in size, the lens realizes a 7x (equivalent to 28-200mm in 35mm format) optical zoom ratio enabling a broad shooting range from wide angle to telephoto. Also, while realizing a high zoom ratio, the lens is exceptionally bright, offering a maximum-aperture range of f/2.4-3.5 to permit the use of fast shutter speeds in low-light conditions as well as making possible background blur effects.",

Supporting optimal image quality in the telephoto range, the new camera incorporates Canon’s renowned shift-type optical Image Stabilizer -previously introduced as the industry’s first for a digital camera- enabling the handheld capture of shots that would otherwise be blurred by camera shake. \n\nIn addition to featuring a 3.2-megapixel CCD sensor, the new Canon PowerShot S1 IS broadens shooting possibilities by offering full-fledged movie recording capability.Offering 30 frame-per-second video capture and resolution up to VGA fine (640×480), the new camera allows users to take smooth movie images with quality approaching that of a digital video camcorder. Also, depending on the resolution setting and capacity of the memory card, individual movie clips can be recorded for up to 60 minutes (maximum file size 1GB). Assisting video capture, the model maintains Auto-Focus, Auto-Exposure and Auto-White-Balance operation while also permitting manual control of such functions as zooming and AF/AE lock while filming. \nThe unit also employs Canon’s high-speed, low-noise Ultrasonic Motor (USM), the world’s first lens-based USM, to minimize noise associated with zooming.",

      "description": "The Canon PowerShot S60 continues the tradition of the popular PowerShot S series, matching an even more compact body design with a full range of advanced digital camera features.\nEquipped with a newly developed 3.6x wide-angle optical zoom lens realizing a zoom range equivalent to 28-100mm in a 35mm format, Canon’s PowerShot S60 permits users the flexibility to shoot anything from sweeping landscapes to close-up portraits. In addition to enabling a wider angle of view and a higher zoom ratio than the PowerShot S50, released in March 2003, the world-first inclusion of a glass-molded Ultra-high refractive index Aspherical (UA) lens has enabled a slim, more compact lens unit and a corresponding reduction in the thickness and weight of the camera.\nIn addition to a high-resolution 1/1.8″ E5-megapixel CCD sensor, which realizes highly detailed images of up to 2,592 x 1,944 pixels, the PowerShot S60 incorporates Canon’s proprietary DIGIC image processor and iSAPS scene recognition technology to achieve industry leading image quality. Enabling processing performance far exceeding that of conventional processors, the renowned DIGIC processor realizes improved image quality, quicker initial start-up time, faster continuous shooting with longer bursts, and improved power consumption. Working in tandem, iSAPS technology uses Photographic Space information drawn from a massive photo database to allow the camera to pre-analyze each scene and optimize auto-focusing, auto-exposure and auto-white-balance performance.\nThe PowerShot S60 offers shooting performance enhancements, including macro photography as close as 4cm, a top shutter speed of 1/2000 of a second, a new “Underwater” white balance preset, VGA (640 x 480 pixels) movie-clip recording and, when shooting in the RAW format, the ability to select the resolution of the JPEG preview image that is simultaneously saved with the RAW file. Moreover, a reduced camera start-up time and a 26% increase in battery capacity ensure that no photo opportunity is lost.\nFurther simplifying photo printing and image file transfers, the unit includes a one-touch Print/Share button. Once the button lights blue, the camera is ready to print directly from Canon’s range of Direct Print-enabled photo printers or other PictBridge-compatible printers, or to download images directly to a Windows® PC. Other new functions include the ID Photo Print, making it easy to produce prints compatible with the major ID-photo sizes of the world, and Movie Print, which enables users to create frame-by-frame prints of movies taken with digital cameras. The camera’s functionality is further extended by a full range of optional accessories, which includes a 2x Teleconverter lens and a Waterproof Case that enables underwater photography at depths up to 40 meters.\nMatching functionality with style, the PowerShot S60 features a sleek two-tone silver body constructed from durable yet chic aluminum-magnesium alloy, and a newly designed slim-line sliding lens cover. Owing to Canon’s newly developed UA lens and advanced mounting technology, the model is also more compact, sporting a body that is 3.2 mm slimmer and 30 grams lighter than the PowerShot S50. Also offering greatly enhanced operability, the S60 features such refinements as a larger zoom lever, which is now located on the rear of the camera, and a large round control pad with the “SET” button located in the center for effortless control.",

      "description": "The Canon PowerShot G6, replacing the G5 released in June 2003, represents the first in a new generation of PowerShot G-series cameras, offering enhanced image quality, functionality, responsiveness and design based on suggestions received from users of previous models.\n\nThe PowerShot G6 features a large-aperture f/2.0-3.0 lens with up to 4x (equivalent to 35-140 mm in the 35 mm format) optical magnification and a newly developed 1/1.8″ 7.1-megapixel CCD sensor. Garnering high acclaim from users of the G5, the lens has been optimized to reap the full benefits of the higher-resolution image sensor, enabling the new camera to deliver the highest level of image quality in its class.\n\nShooting functions include the long-awaited inclusion of wide-area 9-point AiAF. Well received by users of Canon’s IXY DIGITAL series, the feature automatically selects one or more focusing points to accurately achieve auto-focus under a wide variety of shooting conditions.\n\nThe model also offers a Super Macro Function, enabling auto-focus macro shooting from a distance of 5 cm. Moreover, faster AF performance and a shorter start-up time enable high responsiveness.\n\nOffering the first major body design revisions since the G3 model released in 2002, the PowerShot G6 delivers improved operability and styling. The camera’s Vari-Angle LCD monitor, which can be rotated through a horizontal arc of 180 degrees and a vertical arc of 270 degrees for easy framing, has been enlarged from 1.8″ to 2.0″ making it easier to see when framing or confirming shots. In addition, a complete reorganization of the body layout and the use of advanced mounting technologies have enabled savings in weight and size of 30g and more than 10%, respectively, compared with the G5.",

      "description": "The Canon PowerShot A95, incorporating a 3x optical zoom lens (equivalent to 38-114 mm in the 35 mm format), replaces the A80 released in October 2003 as the flagship model of the PowerShot A series.\n\nThe first A-series model to incorporate a 1/1.8″, five-megapixel CCD sensor, Canon’s PowerShot A95 combines a range of advanced new shooting features found on high-end models, including FlexiZone AF/AE, which enables users to move the AF/AE point freely around the viewfinder for easy focusing and spot metering of off-center subjects without having to reframe the shot. The model also features 21 shooting modes – the most of any Canon digital camera – including an eight-setting Special Scene Mode that offers the new Kids & Pets and Night Snapshot settings.\n\nThe Canon PowerShot A95 incorporates an enlarged 1.8″, Vari-Angle LCD monitor offering increased resolution of around 118,000 dots for easier visibility. Enabling rotation through a horizontal arc of 180 degrees and a vertical arc of 270 degrees, the monitor permits easy framing, or folding away for protection when not in use. Further enhancing performance is the addition of the one-touch Print/Share button*, and a full range of optional accessories, including a Tele Converter, Wide Angle Converter and a Waterproof Case enabling underwater photography at depths up to 40 meters.",

      "description": "The 4.0-megapixel Canon IXY DIGITAL 50 takes the IXY signature concepts of style and ultra-compactness to a new level, employing a range of technical and design innovations to realize improved image quality, performance and usability while also achieving further reductions in body size and weight.\n\nThe new IXY DIGITAL 50, following the IXY DIGITAL 30a released in March 2004, are the first of Canon’s compact digital cameras to incorporate the proprietary DIGIC II image engine used in the Canon’s top-of-the line EOS-1D Mark II professional digital SLR model. Realizing drastically improved performance compared with the highly appraised DIGIC architecture, Canon’s new DIGIC II image engine performs detailed processing of large-volume data at extremely high speeds. As a result, the technology enables ultra-fine detail and gradation, natural color reproduction and precise white balance control. DIGIC II also enables outstanding responsiveness and shooting performance, making possible fast startup times, 30% faster AF performance than the IXY DIGITAL 30a, and high-speed writing of image files for consistent continuous-shooting performance.\n\nCanon’s IXY DIGITAL 50 offers boosted optical-zoom performance of 3.0x, compared with 2.0x for the IXY DIGITAL 30a, and a large 2.0″ TFT LCD monitor, compared with a 1.5″ unit for the 30a. At the same time the models boast significant reductions in size and weight compared with the IXY DIGITAL 30a: the IXY DIGITAL 50 being around 3.2 mm thinner, 17% smaller and 35 grams lighter.\n\nContributing to the compact designs, the IXY DIGITAL 50 incorporates the smallest lens in the IXY DIGITAL-series lineup. By utilizing two glass-molded Ultra-high refractive index Aspherical (UA) lens elements, which boast the world’s highest* refractive index, the lens realizes a compact design that measures less than 16.25 mm in length – the diameter of a one-cent euro coin – when fully retracted. The cameras also employ advanced System in Package (SiP) high-density mounting and an ultra-thin battery for further size reductions.\n\nBoosting shooting performance, the IXY DIGITAL 50 offers six Scene Modes, including Kids & Pets, Night Snapshot, and a new Digital Macro setting. The models also boast a full range of video features, allowing users to record and replay video clips with sound at resolutions up to VGA (640 x 480 pixels) with a 30 frames-per-second (fps) frame rate. Also, marking a world’s first for a digital still camera, the duo can record one-minute clips (QVGA: 320 x 240 pixels) at a fast 60 fps frame rate, making possible the smooth capture of moving subjects.\n\nFurther simplifying photo printing and image file transfers, both cameras include a one-touch Print/Share button. Once the button lights blue, the cameras are ready to print directly from Canon’s range of Direct Print-enabled photo printers or other PictBridge-compatible printers, or to download images directly to a Windows® PC. Other new functions include the ID Photo Print, making it easy to produce prints compatible with the major ID-photo sizes of the world, and Movie Print, which enables users to create frame-by-frame prints of movies taken with digital cameras**.",

      "description": "The 3.2-megapizel IXY DIGITAL 40 take the IXY signature concepts of style and ultra-compactness to a new level, employing a range of technical and design innovations to realize improved image quality, performance and usability while also achieving further reductions in body size and weight.\n\nThe IXY DIGITAL 40, following the IXY DIGITAL 30a released in March 2004, are the first of Canon’s compact digital cameras to incorporate the proprietary DIGIC II image engine used in the Canon’s top-of-the line EOS-1D Mark II professional digital SLR model. Realizing drastically improved performance compared with the highly appraised DIGIC architecture, Canon’s new DIGIC II image engine performs detailed processing of large-volume data at extremely high speeds. As a result, the technology enables ultra-fine detail and gradation, natural color reproduction and precise white balance control. DIGIC II also enables outstanding responsiveness and shooting performance, making possible fast startup times, 30% faster AF performance than the IXY DIGITAL 30a, and high-speed writing of image files for consistent continuous-shooting performance.\n\nCanon’s new IXY DIGITAL 40 offers boosted optical-zoom performance of 3.0x, compared with 2.0x for the IXY DIGITAL 30a, and a large 2.0″ TFT LCD monitor, compared with a 1.5″ unit for the 30a. At the same time the models boast significant reductions in size and weight compared with the IXY DIGITAL 30a: the IXY DIGITAL 40 offering savings of around 2.8 mm, 15% and 50 grams.\n\nContributing to the compact designs, the IXY DIGITAL 40 incorporates the smallest lens in the IXY DIGITAL-series lineup. By utilizing two glass-molded Ultra-high refractive index Aspherical (UA) lens elements, which boast the world’s highest* refractive index, the lens realizes a compact design that measures less than 16.25 mm in length – the diameter of a one-cent euro coin – when fully retracted. The cameras also employ advanced System in Package (SiP) high-density mounting and an ultra-thin battery for further size reductions.\n\nBoosting shooting performance, the IXY DIGITAL 40 offer six Scene Modes, including Kids & Pets, Night Snapshot, and a new Digital Macro setting. The models also boast a full range of video features, allowing users to record and replay video clips with sound at resolutions up to VGA (640 x 480 pixels) with a 30 frames-per-second (fps) frame rate. Also, marking a world’s first for a digital still camera, the duo can record one-minute clips (QVGA: 320 x 240 pixels) at a fast 60 fps frame rate, making possible the smooth capture of moving subjects.\n\nFurther simplifying photo printing and image file transfers, both cameras include a one-touch Print/Share button. Once the button lights blue, the cameras are ready to print directly from Canon’s range of Direct Print-enabled photo printers or other PictBridge-compatible printers, or to download images directly to a Windows® PC. Other new functions include the ID Photo Print, making it easy to produce prints compatible with the major ID-photo sizes of the world, and Movie Print, which enables users to create frame-by-frame prints of movies taken with digital cameras**.",

      "description": "The Canon IXY DIGITAL L2 (pronounced “el two”) replaces the popular IXY DIGITAL L released in October 2003. The result of meticulous attention to design, materials and finish, the new model raises the benchmark for camera styling, offering users a choice of four high-fashion color variations* – Platinum Silver, Star Garnet, Midnight Blue and Flannel Gray – with distinct surface finishes that complement each color.\n\nThe IXY DIGITAL L2 incorporates a 1/2.5″ 5.0-megapixel CCD sensor and a high-resolution 6.4 mm (equivalent to 39 mm in 35 mm format) f/2.8 single-focal-length auto-focus lens. In addition to the more powerful CCD, new features for increased imaging performance include wide-area 9-point AiAF, enabling accurate auto-focusing with unrestricted framing regardless of the position of the subject within the viewfinder, and Canon’s SI (Super Intelligent) sensor, which automatically detects the camera’s orientation, ensuring optimum auto-focus, auto-exposure and auto-white-balance performance. Moreover, Canon’s proprietary DIGIC image engine enables processing performance far exceeding that of conventional processors. As a result, the model realizes high image quality, fast initial start-up times, high-speed continuous shooting for long bursts, and low power consumption.\n\nOther features for enhanced functionality include: a selection of five Scene Modes (Portrait, Landscape, Night Snapshot, Indoor, and Underwater), Canon’s one-touch Print/Share button, ID Photo Print, and Movie Print. Moreover, a Super Macro Function enables autofocus macro shooting from a distance of 3 cm, and a Quick Shooting Function achieves an almost lag-free shutter response to ensure that photo opportunities are not lost.",

      "description": "The IXY DIGITAL 600, the flagship model in Canon’s IXY DIGITAL series camera lineup, incorporates dramatic advancements in both design and function. The first IXY DIGITAL model to offer 7-megapixel imaging performance, the camera features a 1/1.8″ 7.1-megapixel CCD sensor and a newly developed retractable 3x zoom lens with a focal length of 37-111mm (35mm film equivalent).\nBased on the design concepts of Deluxe and Luxury, the body of the IXY DIGITAL 600 was created using the Curvature Design method to achieve a sleek and graceful body shape that fits comfortably in the hands. The new look represents the first body-design change in two years, following the design introduced with the launch of the IXY DIGITAL 400 model in March 2003, which was also employed for the 500 and 450 models launched in March 2004.\nThe IXY DIGITAL 600 incorporates Canon’s DIGIC II image engine, which is also featured in the company’s EOS-1Ds Mark II flagship-model digital SLR camera. Designed to improve processing speed and image quality, DIGIC II supports markedly faster camera startup, autofocus and playback performance to deliver enhanced resolution, color gradation and white balance accuracy. Additionally, a Hi-Speed USB 2.0 interface enables high-speed data transfer to a PC.\nCompared with the 500 and 450 models, the 600 realizes a body that is approximately 1.3 mm thinner and 15% smaller in volume. This achievement was made possible through ultra high density mounting using SiP (System in Package), a thinner lens barrel, an ultra-compact optical viewfinder, the use of a compact battery pack, and switching from the use of CompactFlash media cards to SD memory cards.\nThe IXY DIGITAL 600’s large 2.0″ LCD monitor employs a backlight that combines high brightness with energy-saving performance. A new LCD Booster function lets users temporarily increase the brightness level of the monitor when shooting outside in bright-light conditions, while a Night View setting facilitates easier framing and focusing when shooting at dusk or at night.\nThe camera also includes the newly introduced My Colors function, which enables users to freely customize image colors, something that previously was only possible once the images had been downloaded to a PC. My Colors settings are performed on the LCD monitor in real-time when shooting. My Colors offers a selection of 9 modes, including Vivid Blue, Vivid Green, Lighter Skin Tone, Darker Skin Tone, Color Swap, and Custom Color.\nThe IXY DIGITAL 600 supports the PictBridge standard for printing photos directly from PictBridge-compatible printers, regardless of the manufacturer or brand.",

      "description": "The Canon PowerShot S2 IS, which succeeds the 10x-optical-zoom PowerShot S1 IS launched in March 2004, is equipped with a 12x-optical zoom lens which, incorporating an ultrasonic motor (USM), delivers high-speed and exceptionally quiet performance. The lens comes equipped with a shift-type Image Stabilizer (IS), reducing the effects of camera shake when shooting in the telephoto range. An ultra-low dispersion (UD) lens element reduces chromatic aberrations for outstanding imaging performance throughout the entire zoom range.\nEquipped with a 5.0-megapixel CCD, the PowerShot S2 IS realizes a level of image resolution surpassing that of its predecessor, which offered 3.2 million effective pixels. Canon’s proprietary DIGIC II imaging engine supports faster camera startup, autofocus, and playback performance.\nIn addition, the model features dramatic enhancements to video functions, making possible the recording of movies that rival those from dedicated video camcorders. A first for Canon digital cameras, the PowerShot S2 IS offers stereo sound recording capability. Sound quality has also been improved by increasing the maximum sampling rate from 22kHz to 44kHz. The camera ably doubles as a video camcorder in full-motion movie mode, boasting high-definition 640 x 480-pixel VGA resolution at 30 frames per second (fps). A convenient Photo in Movie function allows users to capture high-resolution still images during movie recording simply by pressing the shutter button during recording. Additionally, a Movie Button allows movie recording at any time, regardless of the mode dial setting.\nThe PowerShot’s vari-angle 1.8″ LCD monitor enables users to easily check framing and image appearance. Novice and experienced users alike can also enjoy experimenting with such other functions as Super Macro shooting, which offers extreme close-up shooting up to 0 centimeters, and My Colors, which allows users to freely customize image colors, including the ability to change colors on the LCD monitor in real-time while shooting.",

      "description": "The IXY DIGITAL 700, successor to the stylish high-performance IXY DIGITAL 600 launched in March 2005, marks the first appearance of a large 2.5″ LCD monitor in a Canon compact digital camera. In addition to low power consumption operation and a high-brightness backlight, the camera’s 115,000 dots monitor achieves vertical and horizontal viewing angles approximately 1.5 times wider than those offered by its predecessor for significantly improved visibility.\nCapitalizing on the large LCD monitor, the IXY DIGITAL 700 incorporates a new user interface that maximizes the enjoyment of both shooting and viewing digital photographs. The camera offers a range of new still-image playback options with transition effects when advancing and reversing through images, and when viewing photos in the slide show mode. The model also includes an image rotation function that automatically adjusts the size of playback images to the orientation of the camera. Horizontal and vertical gridlines facilitate framing and image composition when shooting while animated easy-to-understand information displays support greater ease of use.\nIn addition to an ultra high-resolution 7.1-megapixel CCD image sensor, a 3x optical zoom lens, and Canon’s DIGIC II image engine, the IXY DIGITAL 700 features improved white balance control that delivers more faithful and stable color reproduction performance compared with its predecessor. The model also offers the same high level of functionality as the IXY DIGITAL 600, including fast camera startup and high-speed autofocus performance, made possible by DIGIC II, and enables digital zooming when shooting video clips.\nThe stylish IXY DIGITAL 700 was created using the Curvature Design method to achieve a sleek and graceful body shape that fits comfortably in the hands. Complementing the luxurious feel of the body design, the camera is available in two elegant color variations-silver gray and an all-new satin beige-and is specially treated to realize a high-brightness surface finish.\nIXY DIGITAL 700 supports the PictBridge standard for printing photos directly from PictBridge-compatible printers, regardless of the manufacturer or brand. The lineup also ships with the Canon Digital Camera Solution Disk, featuring a range of versatile software applications, including ZoomBrowser EX (Windows) and ImageBrowser (Macintosh), as well as PhotoStitch for combining images into panorama views, and ArcSoft PhotoStudio photo-editing software.",

Also, easily understandable operation was achieved by reviewing the functions and integrating some buttons.\nThis camera is equipped with an approximately 3.2 million camera effective pixel Charge Coupled Device (CCD). In spite of being an entry class model, with “DIGIC II”, higher resolution and high-speed processing were achieved and the startup time and response time were shortened.",

Employing the Curvature Design method to achieve a sleek and graceful body shape that fits comfortably in the hands and offering a choice of four new high-fashion color variations complemented with shiny metallic accenting, the IXY L3 expresses a sophisticated unique styling not seen in other digital cameras.\nCanon’s IXY DIGITAL L3 improves on its predecessor with the incorporation of a retractable 2.4x optical zoom lens (35 mm film equivalent: 38-90 mm), featuring a UA lens element, which represents the smallest zoom lens among Canon digital cameras.\nAdditionally, the L3 model ships with a Camera Station that lets users easily charge their camera. It also enables video output, image transfer to a PC, and direct printing with a PictBridge-compatible printer. Playback on a television is quick and convenient using the included wireless remote control. Moreover, the camera features increased operability with a Vertical Shutter Release function. In the same manner as one-handed image capture is possible on camera-equipped mobile phones, the FUNC./SET button on the back of the camera serves as the shutter-release when the camera is vertically oriented.",

Equipped with an 8.0-megapixel CCD sensor in combination with a glass-molded Ultra-high refractive index Aspherical (UA) lens, the S80 realizes exceptional image quality. The 3.6x wide-angle optical zoom, realizing a zoom range equivalent to 28-100 mm in the 35 mm format, allows users the flexibility to shoot everything from sweeping landscapes to close-up portraits.\nThe employment of a new multi-control dial and omni selector makes possible high-speed operation during image playback or mode selection. Contributing to enhanced operability and easier visibility, the Canon PowerShot S80 incorporates a large 2.5″ LCD screen and improved user interface display. Additionally, the S80 is the first* digital camera to support XGA-resolution (1,024 x 768 pixels) movie recording. The camera defies its slim, compact body design to provide users enhanced performance and functionality.",

      "description": "Canon’s PowerShot A620, which offers full manual operation, replaces the A95 released in September 2004 as the flagship models of the PowerShot A-series.\nThe PowerShot A620 boasts a number of improvements to deliver enhanced usability, starting with a boosted zoom range from 3x to 4x (equivalent to 35-140 mm in the 35 mm format). The cameras’ Vari-Angle LCD monitors, which can easily be rotated through a horizontal arc of 180 degrees and a vertical arc of 270 degrees for easy framing, have been enlarged from 1.8″ to 2.0″ making them easier to see when framing or confirming shots.\nWith the incorporation of Canon’s DIGIC II image engine, the PowerShot A620 demonstrates high responsiveness with significantly shorter start-up times. AF response time is reduced by 60 percent compared with previous models thanks to improvement of the image data reading method and speeding up the movement of the lens mechanism. Lower power consumption enables 2.5 times the number of images that can be captured between battery charges compared with the A95. Moreover, this model offer high-response writing of images to an SD card or MultiMediaCard, and include a Hi-Speed 2.0 USB interface, enabling high-speed transfer of image data to a PC.\nAdvanced users can enjoy the freedom of full manual control, while novice users can progressively develop their abilities with the help of 20 shooting modes, including Portrait, Landscape, Night Scene, My Colors and Special Scene. Additionally, Canon’s PowerShot A620 boasts the series’ first 7.1-megapixel CCD sensor to deliver exceptional image quality.",

Canon’s new Wi-Fi Certified*1 IXY-series digital camera offers high-speed wireless image-data transmission, requiring only about six seconds to transmit a high-resolution 5.0-megapixel image. The IXY DIGITAL WIRELESS ships with a Wireless Print Adapter which, when attached to a PictBridge-compatible printer*2, allows users to enjoy easy and effortless printing without the need for connection cables. Users unfamiliar with wireless LAN systems can still operate the wireless features of the camera with ease since the bundled adapter is preset for use with the camera and does not require complicated initial setup.\nIn addition to offering high-speed wireless transmission of image data to a PC*3, Canon’s IXY DIGITAL WIRELESS enables users to print photographs from a printer connected to a PC using only the print controls on the camera*4. Moreover, with the Auto Transfer function, images captured with the digital camera can be simultaneously transferred to a PC, allowing users to immediately check and share the images on a large display. Another convenient image transfer option is provided by the Wireless Remote Capture feature, which enables users to remotely operate the camera from a PC.\nThe Canon IXY DIGITAL WIRELESS inherits the same outstanding functionality as the IXY DIGITAL 60 introduced in September this year to make possible outstanding image quality and ease of use. The IXY DIGITAL WIRELESS features a high-resolution 5.0-megapixel CCD sensor, an ultra-compact 3x zoom lens, and the DIGIC II image engine for exceptional image quality and fast responsiveness.\nAlso, the IXY DIGITAL WIRELESS incorporates a bright yet energy-efficient 2.0″ LCD monitor and an advanced user interface for easy shooting and playback operation.",

      "description": "The Canon IXY DIGITAL 900 IS, equipped with a lens-shift-type optical image stabilizer (IS), is the first model in the IXY series to offer a wide-angle optical zoom. Employing a compact IS unit and a glass-molded Ultra-high refractive index Aspherical (UA) lens, the IXY 900 IS achieves a wider zoom range while also realizing a slimmer body profile. The 3.8x wide-angle zoom, realizing a zoom range equivalent to 28-105 mm in the 35 mm format, allows users the flexibility to shoot such wide-angle images as sweeping landscapes and close-up portraits.\nThe combination of a 7.1-megapixel CCD sensor and Canon’s proprietary DIGIC III high-speed image engine enables the IXY DIGITAL 900 IS to achieve exceptional image quality throughout the zoom range. Other features adding to the charm of the new IXY 900 IS include a high-resolution 2.5-inch LCD monitor and an elegant, ergonomic body shape based on the Curvature & Wedge Design method.",

The new L4 ships with a camera station that lets users easily charge their camera or hook up to a television to enjoy a large-screen view of their favorite shots. Playback on a television is also made quick and convenient using the wireless remote control included with the camera. Moreover, the model facilitates increased operability with such additional features as a Vertical Shutter Release function. In the same manner that one-handed image capture is possible on camera-equipped mobile phones, the FUNC./SET button on the back of the camera serves as the shutter release when the camera is vertically oriented.",

The camera is equipped with a 7.1-megapixel CCD (increased from 6.0 megapixels) and, with the realization of a further reduction in the size of the lens barrel, achieves a slim-body design that, despite inheriting the same 3x optical-zoom performance, is approximately 2.3 mm thinner than its predecessor. The IXY DIGITAL 10’s square-form body features a high-precision flat-surface design that does away with all ornamental elements as much as possible, highlighting the unit’s slimness while striking a balance between overall aesthetic beauty and functional beauty as a camera. The lens barrel and surrounding ring section on the model’s front cover is available in black or silver color variations, offering users a choice depending on personal preference. The IXY DIGITAL 10 incorporates a 2.5-inch high-resolution (approximately 230,000 dots) “Clear Live LCD” monitor that offers a wide viewing angle and realizes a wide color-reproduction range. A protective cover on the monitor contributes to increased ease of use by reducing glare while also protecting the screen from scratches, dirt and grime.",

The 90 features a large 3.0-inch.\nLive Clear LCD monitor with the same high resolution (approximately 230,000 dots) as the IXY DIGITAL 10. The model achieves a significant improvement in operating ease with the inclusion on the back panel of a Touch Control Dial offering an expanded range of operation selections, and a customizable playback button that allows users to assign various playback functions and quickly switch between playback and shooting modes.\nInheriting the 3x optical zoom lens of its predecessor, the IXY DIGITAL 90 delivers improved image quality through its 7.1-megapixel CCD (increased from 6.0 megapixels) and Canon’s DIGIC III imaging processor. A reduction in the size of the model’s lens barrel has made possible a slimmer camera body characterized by the distinctive Edge Design, which employs a bold juxtaposition of cut surfaces and edge lines. The 90’s black lens barrel and surrounding ring section on the front cover incorporate a spiral pattern that further contributes to the camera’s refined look and feel.",

Like its predecessor, the high-function, high-performance S5 IS features a 12x optical zoom lens equipped with a lens shift image stabilizer and realizes fast, quiet zoom performance by means of a high-speed Ultrasonic Motor (USM).\n\nCompared with its predecessor, the PowerShot S5 IS delivers improved imaging performance through the incorporation of an 8.0-megapixel CCD sensor-increased from 6.0 megapixels in the S3 IS-and an upgrade to Canon’s high-performance DIGIC III image processor from the earlier model’s DIGIC II. Additionally, the S5 IS employs a 2.5-inch high-resolution (approximately 207,000 dots) vari-angle LCD monitor that offers a wide viewing angle to realize a high level of shooting flexibility, and includes a hot shoe for compatibility with Canon EX-series Speedlite flashes.\n\nThe new Canon PowerShot model supports the recording of high-quality movies by enabling users to make use of the camera’s optical zoom and Face Detection AF/AE functions. The S5 IS also offers an LP movie mode, which employs a higher rate of image compression to enable longer recording times for VGA movies, as well as high-quality stereo sound, and seamless transitions between the shooting of still images and movie recording.",

The 820 IS features increased optical-zoom magnification, distinguishing the camera as the first IXY DIGITAL model to be equipped with a 5x zoom lens, along with improved image-stabilization technology that delivers an even higher level of precision accuracy, providing image stabilization equivalent to approximately four shutter-speed stops.*\nIncorporating a 10.0-megapixel CCD sensor, the IXY 820 IS allows users to enjoy exceptionally high-resolution photos. The camera delivers improved ease of use through a 2.5-inch “Clear Live LCD II” monitor that realizes high visibility and a Controller Wheel supporting convenient operation.\nThe IXY DIGITAL 820 IS features a refined, sophisticated design that evokes the impression of a body enveloped in an elegant gown. The form of the camera not only conveys a feeling of style, but also fits comfortably in the hands.",

The new 95 IS is equipped with a 3x optical zoom lens newly incorporating an optical image stabilizer, and a CCD sensor offering a higher 10.0-megapixel resolution. The model’s 3.0-inch monitor features the more advanced Clear Live LCD II for greater visibility. Additionally, replacing the Touch Wheel employed by its predecessor, the 95 IS includes a Controller Wheel for improved operational ease. The innovative design of the IXY DIGITAL 95 IS features a square body shape with large beveled edges along the top and bottom portions of the front cover panel. Additionally, the flat “sheet-key” operation panel contributes to the camera’s progressive look and feel.",

The G11 incorporates a Dual Anti-Noise System, comprised of an ultra high-resolution 10.0-megapixel CCD sensor and DIGIC 4 image processor, for greatly reduced noise and expanded dynamic range. This allows users to capture beautiful photos with minimal noise and optimal exposure even in scenes with little light or high contrasts in brightness levels, both difficult shooting environments for conventional compact digital cameras. While inheriting such characteristics of its predecessor model as a wide-angle 28 mm* 5x optical zoom lens, diverse manual recording functions, RAW data recording capability, and compatibility with EOS-series accessories, the PowerShot G11 also incorporates such new advents as a much demanded Vari-Angle 2.8-inch Clear Live LCD V monitor, giving it a variety of features befitting Canon’s flagship compact digital camera.",

Compared with its predecessor, the A1100 IS released in February 2009, the A3100 IS has a body design measuring approximately 2.9 mm thinner and weighing approximately 47 grams lighter, and also enables the shooting of up to approximately 100 more photos between recharges. The model features an alumite-finish aluminum front cover for a sophisticated look and feel and enlarged rear-panel buttons for improved ease of operation.\nLike the SX210 IS, the new A3100 IS offers the improved Smart Auto mode with Smart FE and, among its creative scene modes, includes the Super Vivid mode, which creates an enhanced color effect by increasing the hue and saturation of the captured image, and the Poster Effect mode, which limits the color gradation of the image to create the nostalgic impression reminiscent of an old-style poster.\nThe Canon PowerShot A3100 IS also includes a high-visibility 2.7-inch LCD monitor and a movie function supporting video capture up to VGA (640 x 480). It also incorporates a Low Light mode for enhanced imaging performance when shooting in reduced-light conditions and supports high-capacity SDXC memory cards. The model is available in three stylish body colors: silver, blue and red.",

      "description": "The Canon IXY 10S, successor to the IXY DIGITAL 930 IS model released in September 2009, does away with back-panel external buttons to feature intuitive touch panel operation via the high-resolution 3.5-inch (approximately 461,000 dots) PureColor System LCD T monitor, an increase of 0.5-inches over its predecessor. The Touch Auto Focus feature allows users to select a subject to focus on from the touch panel, and maintain focus until the shutter button has been pushed to enable the capture of beautiful photos, even when a subject is moving. Additional features include an Active Display function allowing users to control image playback by lightly tapping the left or right areas of the camera to toggle between the next or previous images, as well as the Touch Action feature that calls up various playback menus by simply swiping a finger across the touch screen. The touch panel menu supports effortless menu navigation and allows users to assign frequently used or preferred icons, and select from among four background and icon colors for a customized menu experience.\nThe Canon IXY 10S features a wide-angle 24 mm* f/2.8 5x zoom lens and high-resolution 14.1-megapixel CCD sensor to deliver increased image quality and enhanced functionality. In addition, the model accommodates large-capacity SDXC memory cards, makes possible HD video capture at 1,280 x 720 pixels and 30 frames per second (fps), and includes a built-in HDMI mini connector supporting playback on HD televisions.",

The popular Smart Auto mode newly includes Smart FE (Flash Exposure), which improves image quality by automatically controlling flash illumination, shutter speed, aperture and ISO speed.\n\nThe SX210 IS’s HD movie function delivers a range of convenient features to support outstanding video-capture performance. In addition to recording high-resolution 1,280 x 720 pixel video and high-quality stereo audio, the camera also allows users to take advantage of the 14x optical zoom while shooting movies to capture facial expressions and get close to the action. Additionally, the camera’s special Movie Button ensures that no movie-taking opportunity is lost. With the push of a button, users can immediately begin recording movies, even when shooting still images.\n\nThe Smart Auto feature also ensures optimum results when taking movies by automatically selecting ideal settings and image processing based on 18 predefined shooting situations. Additionally, the Dynamic mode effectively compensates for pronounced camera shake such as that which can occur when shooting video while walking. The Canon PowerShot SX210 IS’s built-in HDMI mini connector (HDMI cable sold separately) supports data transfer for the enjoyment of viewing high-resolution still images and HD movies on large-screen televisions.",

      "description": "The PowerShot A3200 IS is equipped with a wide-angle 28 mm*1 5x optical zoom lens, the high-performance DIGIC 4 image processor and a 14.1-megapixel CCD image sensor. Like the SX230 HS, the camera lets users take advantage of the Smart Auto feature with newly added Advanced Subject Detection. Capable of identifying 32 shooting scenes, Smart Auto selects the best-suited settings to ensure optimal imaging performance.\n\nLive View Control allows the easy adjustment of various picture settings while framing a shot. Using a simple slide-bar tool displayed on the camera's 2.7-inch LCD monitor, users can adjust between light and dark, neutral and vivid, and cool and warm characteristics. Since changes to settings are immediately reflected in the image displayed on the LCD monitor, users can make adjustments without the need for specialized photographic knowledge.\n\nThe model's movie function records HD 1,280 x 720 video at 30 fps and makes possible the shooting of Miniature Effect movies, which enhances perspective to create the appearance of a scene shot with miniature models. When shooting in locations where flash photography is restricted, a new Discreet mode disables the flash and all camera sounds, allowing users to capture photos without causing disturbance to those around them.\n\nThe A3200 IS, Canon's first A-series model to employ aluminum in both the front and back covers, features a stylish body design and is available in three body colors: pink, blue and silver.",

The HS System, which combines a low-noise, high-sensitivity 12.1-megapixel CMOS image sensor and Canon’s high-performance DIGIC 4 image processor, delivers beautiful imaging results with minimal blur and reduced noise, allowing users to capture a moment, even when shooting in low-light conditions such as night scenes or indoor settings, without using a flash or tripod.\n\nThe IXY 31S’s Smart Auto function newly includes Advanced Subject Detection, enabling the automatic detection and tracking of such non-human subjects as pets and vehicles to ensure that such subjects remain in focus with the proper exposure within the frame. Furthermore, with the addition of four new scenes, the camera now incorporates a total of 32 specially defined shooting scenes.\n\nIncorporating a wide 3.2-inch (approximately 461,000 dots) Clear Live LCD T monitor, the new IXY model allows users to intuitively perform such operations as selecting a subject to focus on from the touch panel and maintain focus until the shutter button has been pushed. It also enables users to customize the menu display to create their own personalized icon layouts.\n\nThe new Canon IXY 31S supports the recording of Full HD 1,920 x 1,080 video at 24 frames per second (fps) with high-quality stereo sound. A new Movie Digest function*2 enables the creation of short movies comprising brief video clips captured in the seconds before each still photo was captured. This feature automatically records video of the up to four seconds of time just prior to the instant the shutter button is pressed, and compiles each day’s video clips into a short movie. In addition, the model supports the iFrame video format*3 facilitating improved video-editing ease, allowing users to quickly distribute and share video content over the Internet.",

      "description": "The new Canon PowerShot SX40 HS improves upon the image quality and functionality of its predecessor, the PowerShot SX30 IS, released October 2010, to enable users to enjoy shooting at a range of angles of view, from wide angle to telephoto. The camera’s 24 mm*1 35x optical zoom lens includes Hi-UD (Hi-index UD) and UD (ultra-low dispersion) lens elements to effectively correct for a variety of aberrations that can easily occur in the telephoto range.The PowerShot SX40 HS’s image stabilization function newly incorporates Intelligent IS, a feature that automatically selects optimal image stabilization settings based on the shooting situation.The Canon PowerShot SX40 HS employs the new DIGIC 5 image processor, which includes a new noise-reducing algorithm to deliver even further improvements in image quality and functionality. Featuring the HS System, which combines the new DIGIC 5 with a high-sensitivity 12.1-megapixel CMOS sensor, the camera realizes an approximately one-fourth reduction*2 in the level of noise occurrence compared with the previous model, the SX30 IS, achieving beautiful imaging results in even low-light conditions. Also supported by DIGIC 5, the newly incorporated Multi-area White Balance function enables optimal white balance performance even when shooting with a flash or when capturing images in areas illuminated by mercury-vapor lighting.",

Employing a straight retractable lens system, the camera’s lens configuration measures only 18.89 mm across, enabling it to be contained within the area of a one yen coin, when the power is switched off and lens retracted. With a body depth measuring only 22.1 mm, the 600F’s compact design achieves the world’s thinnest 8x optical zoom lens camera.\nThe Canon IXY 600F newly includes Intelligent IS, a feature that automatically selects optimal image stabilization settings based on the shooting situation, such as during normal conditions, macro shooting and when using a tripod. Further contributing to beautiful, more effortless imaging, the camera features the HS System, which combines a low-noise, high-sensitivity 12.1-megapixel CMOS sensor and Canon’s high-performance DIGIC 4 image processor to deliver minimal blur and reduced noise when shooting in even low-light conditions, such as night scenes or indoor settings, without using a flash or tripod.",

      "description": "The new Canon PowerShot S100 delivers improved image quality and performance compared with its predecessor, the S95, released in August 2010, to satisfy users seeking a compact, high-performance camera. The S100’s newly designed bright f/2.0 aperture, 24 mm*1 5x optical zoom lens enables faster shutter speeds than those offered by conventional lenses and, working together with the HS System, delivers superior imaging even in low-light settings.\nInheriting advanced technologies cultivated for the EOS Digital series of digital SLR cameras, the PowerShot S100’s newly developed 1/1.7-inch 12.1-megapixel Canon CMOS sensor realizes low-noise results even in unfavorable lighting.\nFurther contributing to enhanced image quality and performance, the PowerShot S100 incorporates Canon’s newest image processor, DIGIC 5, which features a new noise-reducing algorithm. Compared with the DIGIC 4, the new DIGIC 5 processes approximately four times the amount of information at approximately six times the processing speed, and is capable of eliminating low-frequency (color) noise. Incorporating the HS System, which combines the newly developed high-sensitivity CMOS sensor with the new DIGIC 5 image processor, the S100 achieves a one-fourth*2 reduction in the occurrence of noise compared with its predecessor. The HS System delivers not only enhanced high-sensitivity performance, but also a normal ISO range that has been expanded up to ISO6400 for even more beautiful results when shooting in low-light settings.\nAdditionally, the Multi-area White Balance function enables optimal white balance performance even when shooting with a flash or when capturing images in areas illuminated by mercury-vapor lighting.\nThe Canon PowerShot S100 comes equipped with a built-in GPS (Global Positioning System) antenna, which enables the camera to automatically receive GPS satellite signals and record the information on Exif data.",

The newly developed CMOS sensor is approximately 6.3 times larger than the 1/1.7-inch sensor employed in the G1 X’s predecessor, the PowerShot G12 (released in October 2010), and has a height dimension comparable to that of APS-C size sensors, making possible a level of image quality that approaches that of digital SLR cameras. In addition to offering an ISO range of up to 12800, the sensor’s improved dynamic range enables smooth, natural gradation expression. The camera’s sensor, newly developed lens and DIGIC 5 combine to deliver impressive background blur similar to that realized by a digital SLR camera*1 while also realizing superlative noise-reduction performance for outstanding imaging performance in most any shooting situation.\nThe newly designed 4x optical zoom lens (28-112 mm*2/ f/2.8-f/5.8) incorporates a large-diameter UA lens element comparable in size to those employed in Canon’s EF lenses and three glass-molded lens elements to reduce spherical aberration and correct for curvature of field while also minimizing color fringing. The lens facilitates the maximum capabilities of the camera’s large CMOS sensor and DIGIC 5 image processor to achieve exceptional image quality.\nThe G1 X’s outstanding operability, functionality and expandability offer appeal even to digital SLR camera users. It includes an electronic dial that enables quick and easy setting changes while maintaining a hold on the grip, supports the same 14-bit RAW shooting as Canon’s EOS series of digital SLR cameras, and accommodates Speedlite flash units and other EOS-series accessories.",

The feature has been enhanced to newly include Face ID, a function that allows users to register on the camera the face, name and birthday of subjects. Face ID enables the camera to detect and prioritize the pre-registered faces during shooting, even from within large groups, automatically adjusting focus and brightness. When the camera recognizes the subject as a child, it will automatically switch on Servo AF to deliver proper focus and exposure. For infants, the camera will automatically disable the flash and adjust exposure, making possible natural imaging expression without disturbing the subject.\nThe 420F features Intelligent IS, which automatically selects optimal image stabilization settings based on the shooting situation, such as during normal conditions, macro shooting, and when using a tripod. By combining Smart AUTO, which newly includes Face ID, with Intelligent IS, the camera is capable of automatically detecting and applying the ideal camera and image processing settings based on up to 205 different shooting situations.\nEmploying a wireless transfer function, the new IXY 420F enables users to send captured images and video directly to smartphone devices, computers and other Canon products that support Wi-Fi connectivity, allowing images and video to be shared easily via e-mail, social networking sites (SNS) and video-sharing sites.\nThe IXY 420F incorporates Canon’s newest high-performance image processor, DIGIC 5. Compared with DIGIC 4, the new processor processes approximately four times the amount of information at approximately six times the processing speed, and delivers a one-fourth* reduction in the occurrence of noise. Supporting Canon’s HS System, DIGIC 5, combined with a 16.1-megapixel high-sensitivity CMOS sensor offering low-noise performance, delivers minimal blur and reduced noise, even when shooting in low-light conditions, such as night scenes or indoor settings, without using a flash or tripod.\nEquipped with a 3.2-inch Wide Touch Panel that supports Touch Shutter, the IXY 420F allows users to determine the ideal timing in which to capture a photo simply by touching the viewing monitor.",

The camera features Smart AUTO with Face ID that, combined with Intelligent IS, detects and automatically applies the optimal settings based on up 205 different shooting scenes. Furthermore, the IXY 1 enables images and video to be sent wirelessly to smartphones, computers or other Canon products with Wi-Fi connectivity, enabling video and images to be shared via e-mail, SNS and video sharing sites.\nIn addition to a 3.2-inch Wide Touch Panel monitor, the IXY 1 features the HS System, which combines a high-sensitivity approximately 10.1-megapixel CMOS sensor and high-performance DIGIC 5 image processor to deliver beautiful imaging results even in low-light settings. Other features supporting exceptional performance include Full HD video recording, ZoomPlus technology enabling up to 21x digital zoom, and an improved shutter-release time-lag performance that has been reduced by approximately 17% compared with its predecessor, the IXY 51S, released in September 2011.\nThe IXY 1 features aesthetically pleasing dimensions that adhere to the golden ratio (1.618:1), a ratio of harmonious proportions that have been used throughout history in art and architecture.",

Equipped with a high-torque motor and a double-layer glass construction that prevents lens condensation, the D20 is capable of operating in temperatures down to -10°C,*2 and is designed to withstand the shock*3 from a drop of up to 1.5 meters, an improvement over the 1.22 meter range of its predecessor, the D10 (released in April 2009).\n\nConvenient operating features that support outdoor use include a built-in GPS antenna that lets users automatically record where and when their images are taken, and an Underwater Macro mode that supports underwater close-up shooting. Additionally, the D20 makes switching between its Auto, Underwater and Snow modes as easy as the press of a button.\n\nCombining a high-sensitivity, approximately 12.1-megapixel CMOS sensor and Canon’s DIGIC 4 image processor, the D20’s HS System ensures exceptional imaging performance when shooting underwater and in other low-light conditions.",

      "description": "The new Canon PowerShot SX50 HS is the world’s first*1 compact camera to feature a 50x optical zoom lens (24-1200 mm*2). By optimizing the refractive power allocation of each lens group and amount of movement, the camera measures only 105.5 mm in depth, making it thinner than its predecessor, the 35x optical zoom PowerShot SX40 HS (released in September 2011). The camera employs three UD (ultra-low dispersion) lenses and an aspherical lens to correct for chromatic aberrations at the telephoto end.\nThe HS System, which combines a high-sensitivity 1/2.3-inch approximately 12.1-million-effective pixel CMOS sensor (back-illuminated type) and the high-performance DIGIC 5 image processor, makes possible the capture of high-quality images with low noise while maintaining a high level of resolution and color reproduction. Furthermore, thanks to advances in image processing and optimized magnification settings, ZoomPlus technology extends the camera’s zoom range up to approximately 100x through digital magnification while maintaining a high level of image resolution.\nThe Zoom Framing Assist Seek button quickly zooms out to assist users in relocating and framing a subject that has been lost after zooming in. Once found, a simple release of the button returns the camera to the initial magnification range. Furthermore, a Zoom Framing Assist Lock button allows users to shoot their desired composition during telephoto shooting while minimizing camera shake. The PowerShot SX50 HS also offers a range of exceptional basic features, including a 2.8-inch wide vari-angle LCD.",

With a minimum focusing distance of 1 cm, the camera makes possible exceptional imaging results with subtle detail during macro shooting.\n\nFeaturing an improved AF algorithm and faster data-reading from the image sensor, the PowerShot G15 performs AF in 0.17 seconds*2 during wide-angle photography—an approximately 53% reduction compared with its predecessor—realizing the fastest*3 AF performance of any Canon compact camera. Furthermore, the G15’s lag time has been significantly reduced from the previous model’s 0.40 seconds*2 to 0.22 seconds*2 during wide-angle photography. Ensuring that no important photo opportunity is lost, a High-Speed Burst HQ function makes possible a continuous shooting speed of approximately 10 images per second at the camera’s full resolution of approximately 12.1 megapixels.\n\nIn addition to employing a newly developed high-sensitivity Canon CMOS sensor with approximately 12.1 million effective pixels, the PowerShot G15 features the same image processor incorporated in the G12, the DIGIC 5, which delivers approximately six times the processing power of DIGIC 4. Supporting the HS System, the CMOS sensor and DIGIC 5 combination makes possible even further enhanced high-sensitivity performance. Offering an ISO range of up to 12800, the G15 minimizes blur and noise, even when shooting in low-light conditions, such as night scenes and indoor settings, without requiring a flash or tripod.\n\nIntelligent IS automatically selects optimal image stabilization settings based on the shooting situation, such as during normal conditions, macro shooting and when using a tripod. In addition, the Canon PowerShot G15 employs a Dual Axis Electronic Level, which allows users to confirm the inclination level of the camera not only in the previously supported roll direction, but also in the pitch direction.\n\nFeaturing exceptional functionality and expandability that even EOS users will find appealing, the camera includes an electronic dial that enables quick and easy setting adjustment while maintaining a hold on the grip, delivering an operational feel similar to that of a digital SLR camera. Offering enhanced visibility, the G15 employs dual-level control dials—one for exposure adjustment and the other to change shooting modes. The camera supports Full HD 1,980 x 1,080 video recording at 24 frames per second with stereo sound and features a high-resolution LCD with approximately 922,000 dots.",

By allowing images to be captured using either the top or bottom portions of the ring provides users with greater freedom and flexibility when shooting. In addition, a tilt touch-panel LCD offering 90 degrees of tilt enables shooting from a wide range of angles and positions, such as from high and low angles, for additional photographic freedom.\n\nThe PowerShot N is equipped with a new Mobile Device Connect Button, which allows the camera to connect via Wi-Fi to a pre-registered smartphone or tablet PC with a single touch of a button.*3",

      "description": "Incorporating Canon’s newly developed DIGIC 6 image processor, the PowerShot SX280 HS supports the capture of Full HD video at 60 frames per second (fps),*1 enabling the recording of smooth video with minimal afterimage even when shooting actively moving subjects. When capturing Full HD video at 30 fps, the camera’s ISO 1600 setting minimizes noise to a level equivalent*2 to the ISO 400 setting of its predecessor, the PowerShot SX260 HS (released in March 2012). Furthermore, compared with DIGIC 5, the new DIGIC 6 image processor records approximately four times the amount of data, enabling the capture of smooth, high-resolution video. Combining optical image stabilization with digital correction made possible by DIGIC 6, the camera significantly reduces the effects of handshake for five different types of movement—horizontal, vertical, roll, pitch and yaw—which is particularly useful when recording while walking or riding in a moving vehicle.\n\nThe PowerShot SX280 HS’s 20x optical zoom lens features a zoom range from 25 mm to 500 mm (35 mm film equivalent) and employs two double-sided aspherical lens elements and an UD (ultra-low dispersion) lens element to effectively correct for aberrations across the entire zoom range. In addition, ZoomPlus technology, which applies the optimal image-processing settings based on the level of magnification, extends the camera’s zoom range up to approximately 40x through digital magnification while maintaining a high level of resolution.\n\nFeaturing an advanced Wi-Fi connectivity function, the Canon PowerShot SX280 HS saves a history of the last three connections used for uploading and sharing images through Wi-Fi, enabling users to more easily and quickly send images to frequently used smartphones, tablet devices*3 or SNS (Social Networking Service) sites. The camera allows not only photos to be uploaded to Facebook, but also text to be posted*4 on Facebook, YouTube and Twitter.\n\nThe Canon PowerShot SX280 HS is equipped with a built-in GPS (Global Positioning System) receiver, which automatically records the latitude, longitude, elevation and UTC time (coordinated Universal Time) at which an image was captured. The camera can also obtain GPS assist data*5 using Wi-Fi, which greatly reduces the amount of time needed to acquire positioning data compared with the previous model.",

Incorporating three UD lens elements, the lens achieves high image quality that effectively corrects for chromatic aberration even at the telephoto end of the zoom range. Additionally, Progressive Fine Zoom digitally extends the camera’s zooming capabilities to approximately 60x while maintaining high imaging performance.\nOptical image stabilization and digital image stabilization made possible through DIGIC 6 combine to realize five-axis image stabilization, minimizing camera shake when shooting movies. Additionally, Zoom Framing Assist makes zooming in and framing subjects quick and effortless, a feature that is particularly beneficial when taking advantage of the camera’s 30x optical zoom. Should users lose sight of their subject when zooming in, a press of the Zoom Framing Assist button will quickly cause the lens to zoom out so the subject can be re-located and framed accordingly.\nThe PowerShot SX700 HS also offers a Creative Shot mode which, in addition to the original shot, produces and saves five additional variations that apply filter options based on the scene, subject and exposure. It also includes a Mobile Device Connect Button that lets users easily connect the camera to a smartphone or tablet device.",

Additionally, the Self Portrait mode, which is automatically activated when the LCD screen is raised to 180°, enhances self-portraits by applying a brightening and smoothing effect, and creating a soft background blur.\nWhen shooting in the Creative Shot mode, in addition to capturing the original composition, the camera automatically produces and saves five additional variations that apply filter variations based on the scene, subject and exposure to create a set of impressive artistic images. Users can also color filters grouped into Retro, Monochrome, Special and Natural categories to match personal preferences. The PowerShot N2's Creative Shot mode has been expanded to include a fun movie function that produces short film montages using up to four shorter video clips.\nThe PowerShot N2 also offers users the convenience of built-in Wi-Fi and NFC (Near Field Communication) technology to support the wireless transmission of image and movie data.",

      "description": "The PowerShot SX710 HS, despite its slim body with a thickness of approximately 34.8 mm, features a 25–750 mm (35 mm film equivalent) 30x optical zoom lens that, through ZoomPlus, can be digitally extended to approximately 60x while maintaining high imaging performance.\nCombining a high-sensitivity approximately 20.3 million effective pixel CMOS image sensor and Canon's high-performance DIGIC 6 image processor, the SX710 achieves exceptional imaging results with reduced blur and noise even when shooting in low-light conditions. Furthermore, the camera offers improved image stabilization with 5-axis Advanced Dynamic IS, which includes a newly added “high” setting to ensure steady image capture even when shooting while running.\nBuilt-in Wi-Fi technology lets users easily transfer photos and videos to a smartphone, tablet or other mobile device,*1 or to a PC, an online photo album or any of a variety of social networking and media sites,*2 as well as to a Wi-Fi-equipped printer. Additionally, built-in NFC (Near Field Communication) technology eliminates the need to manually find and open the Canon Camera Connect app on a user's mobile device. By simply touching the NFC icon on the camera to a compatible Android™ device,*3 the Camera Connect app will launch automatically for the quick, easy sharing of images.*4\nZoom Framing Assist makes zooming in and framing subjects quick and effortless, a feature that is particularly beneficial when taking advantage of the SX710 HS’s high zoom magnification. Should users lose sight of their subject when zooming in, a press of the Zoom Framing Assist button will quickly cause the lens to zoom out so the subject can be re-located and framed accordingly.",

      "description": "In response to the demands of discerning advanced-amateur shooters, the PowerShot G5 X is the first G-series model equipped with a 0.39-inch approximately 2.36-million-dot EVF. Delivering exceptional operability during viewfinder shooting, the EVF employs an organic EL (electroluminescent) panel that not only achieves a high level of resolution, but also offers a wide color gamut and high contrast. Furthermore, the EVF incorporates a Canon-proprietary eyepiece lens that makes possible approximately 100-percent coverage while ensuring high-resolution performance through to the periphery of the viewing area.\n\nDrawing on Canon’s extensive optical technologies, the G5 X features a bright f/1.8–2.8 24–100 mm (35 mm film equivalent) 4.2x optical zoom lens that realizes high image quality from the wide-angle to telephoto ends with minimal blur and noise even in low-light conditions. Comprising eleven elements in nine groups, the lens includes a UD (ultra-low dispersion) lens element that effectively minimizes the occurrence of chromatic aberrations and three aspherical lens elements that correct for curvature of field as well as spherical aberrations that can occur at the telephoto end.\n\nThe PowerShot G5 X combines a bright lens with a large 1.0-inch 20.2-million-effective-pixel backlit CMOS sensor to make possible imaging with rich color gradation and beautiful background blurring characteristics. The sensor, in addition to featuring a high pixel count, realizes a surface area that is approximately four-times larger than that offered by 1/2.3-inch image sensors commonly used in digital compact cameras and approximately 6.7-times larger than that of the 1/3-inch sensors often used in smartphones. Thanks to its large size, each pixel commands a large light-gathering area, enabling the G5 X to achieve a high level of sensitivity while minimizing noise even when shooting in low-light environments.\n\nThe camera includes a Manual Movie mode that allows aperture, shutter speed and ISO settings to be changed even while recording video. Furthermore, an Auto Level Compensation function* automatically corrects for camera angle to ensure subjects remain level during video shooting.",

They also include a range of new features to meet the needs of professional users, such as improved operability through the addition of a manual iris ring, and enhanced customization for image-quality and shooting-function settings.\nFurthermore, in response to advanced professional needs, the XL H1S incorporates an HD-SDI terminal that supports the output of uncompressed video with embedded audio and LTC time code.\n\nThe XL H1S and XL H1A feature three 1/3-inch CCDs with 1.67 million pixels* for each primary color and Canon’s exclusive DIGIC DV II HD digital signal processing chip, making possible the recording and playback of high-resolution HDV 1080i-format video.\n\nThe XL H1S and XL H1A come equipped with Canon’s newly developed 20x HD Video Zoom Lens XL 5.4-108 mm L IS III. In addition to a fluorite lens element, which corrects residual chromatic aberration that optical glass lens elements cannot entirely remove, and an optical image stabilization system, the new lens incorporates a manual iris ring. Multi-coating enables the lens to also correct for a variety of aberrations while an SR coating reduces ghosting to ensure exceptional HD imaging performance.",

      "description": "The  Canon XH G1S and XH A1S succeed the XH G1 and XH A1 video camcorders launched in the fourth quarter of 2006, whose high mobility earned favorable reviews from professionals in the fields of broadcasting and video  production. Offering the superlative optical performance and imaging engine hallmark to the XH series, the new camcorders not only enable high-quality HD recording, but also feature improved zoom lens operability and revised audio specifications in response to the needs of professional users.\n\nThe XH G1S and XH A1S are equipped with three 1/3-inch CCDs, each with approximately 1.67 million pixels*1 and the high-performance DIGIC DV II image processor to record high-quality HD video. The models’ 20x HD Video Zoom L Lens incorporates a fluorite lens elements to correct residual chromatic aberration and an Ultra Low Dispersion lens. The duo also features an optical image stabilization system to support the recording of steady images, even at long focal lengths.The zoom lens’s focus, zoom, and iris rings are now better separated to allow easier handling, and further improve operability by enabling users to customize driving torque and reaction speed while shooting. Focus and zoom operations have also been improved so that they allow manual focusing during zooming, increasing the range of image expression.\n\nFor audio input, the XH G1S and XH A1S can simultaneously record sound through the internal mike as well as via the XLR terminal, and allow users to independently adjust sensitivity settings for each channel during XLR input. Advents such as the ability to use the limiter function, which prevents aberrations in voice quality caused by sudden increases in audio volume, when recording audio manually provide extra convenience when shooting in professional settings.Additionally, the XH G1S and XH A1S incorporate a variety of functions suited for professional shooting, including an expanded white balance range that can be adjusted from 2,000–15,000K, and the Push AE function, which corrects exposure at the push of a button during manual shooting. The models also feature indentations around control buttons to prevent operation errors, allowing users to shoot with more confidence.\n\nThe XH G1S offers an expanded range of shooting applications through its three terminals, providing HD-SDI with embedded audio/TC (LTC) output,Genlock, and Time Code input/output.",

In addition, the iVIS HF 21 include a variety of features to accommodate shooting in an expanded range of scenes, such as a Night Scene Mode setting, which allows users to capture aesthetic nighttime scenery exactly as they see it with their own eyes.\n\nThe Canon iVIS HF21 delivers high-quality HD recording in a compact body size weighing 340 grams, and features a 3.89-megapixel full HD CMOS sensor and DIGIC DV III image processor for fast processing and high image quality.

An updated Video Snapshot Mode, which records a series of 4-second video “snapshots” and replays them with musical tracks included on the internal flash memory, can now be used to splice together video movies that have already been recorded, while Underwater Mode facilitates convenient underwater shooting when the iVIS HF21 is used in conjunction with the Canon WP-V1 Waterproof Case (sold separately). Users can shoot in Underwater Mode to avoid the bluish tint that commonly occurs in underwater photography and capture high-quality full HD video with a natural color palette, or when above water switch to Surface Mode, a shooting setting ideal for recording above-water. In response to requests from divers, the camcorder allows users to toggle between the Surface and Underwater Modes without having to remove the WP-V1 Waterproof Case for improved user-friendliness.",

      "description": "The new Canon XF305 and XF300 camcorders incorporate an upgraded lens, image sensor, and image processor, and feature a new file-based recording codec to achieve high-definition video output across a wide range of industry applications such as newsgathering and program production. Designed with professional users in mind, the new models realize enhanced ease-of-use and operability, while the XF305 features an increased range of connection terminals for increased expandability during video production.\n\nThe XF305 and XF300 incorporate a wide-angle 29.3 mm* f/1.6 Canon HD Video L Lens with 18x optical zoom to deliver over 1,000 TV lines of resolution. The lens utilizes UD, UA, and Hi-UD elements, which correct a variety of aberrations while contributing to the lens’s compact design, as well as enhanced optical image stabilization for improved camera shake correction.\n\nUtilizing newly developed Full HD CMOS sensors, the new XF305 and XF300 feature a three-CMOS sensor system, one for each primary color, delivering faithful color reproduction. Each 1/3-inch CMOS sensor incorporates approximately 2.07-million effective pixels for 1,920 x 1,080 Full HD recording, and realizes reduced noise and rolling shutter distortion (a phenomenon where subjects are distorted at an angle during high-speed movement).Additionally, the sensors also achieve faster signal readout, and make possible slow- and fast-motion recording. The models incorporate the DIGIC DV III Image Processor, which delivers enhanced performance through such capabilities as high-precision gamma processing, new image adaptive processing for smooth gradation expression, face detection technology, and an enhanced Custom Picture function supporting a diverse range of image adjustments.\n\nThe Canon XF305 and XF300 feature an MPEG-2 Full HD (4:2:2) file-based recording codec, enabling the management and storage of video and audio data in a similar fashion to PC data. MPEG-2 Full HD (MPEG-2 422P@HL compliant) compression makes possible 1,920 x 1,080-pixel Full HD video recording, while 4:2:2 color sampling offers twice the volume of color data and provides double the level of color resolution for enhanced color-related editing accuracy and quality when compared to the 4:2:0 profile format used in HDV. The codec realizes a maximum 50 Mbps data recording,approximately twice the data volume of HDV, and supports the MXF (Material eXchange Format) file format, making the camcorders ideally suited for non-linear editing systems.\n\nThe new camcorders record to lightweight, easily accessible and highly reliable flash memory CF cards, which allow for random access to recorded media, and incorporate two memory card slots enabling continuous relay recording.",

      "description": "The  Canon iVIS HF M32 incorporates 64GB of internal flash memory—twice the capacity of its predecessor—enabling up to 24 hours and 30 minutes*1 of video recording. The model features a Relay Recording function that makes possible uninterrupted data capture to an SD/SDHC/SDXC memory card when the internal flash memory is full. When using a 64GB SDXC memory card, the unit is capable of recording up to 49 hours*1 of video.\n\nThe Canon iVIS HF M32 features a Smart Auto mode, which enables the effortless shooting of exceptional video by intelligently detecting and analyzing*2 subjects, brightness, color, distance and movement. The camcorder then automatically applies optimal settings based on a classification of 31 shooting scenes, which are displayed as icons on the unit’s LCD screen.\n\nIncorporating a 2.7-inch Touch Panel LCD, the new Canon iVIS HF M32 includes such functions as Touch and Track, which delivers precise focus and exposure for a subject selected on the model’s touch panel, and Touch Focus, which allows users to quickly focus on a chosen subject. In addition, the Face Detection feature enables users to choose a specific face to track as the main subject while Touch Exposure allows the exposure setting to be locked or compensated for in the selected area.\nPowered IS, enhanced optical image stabilization, provides compensation for subtle hand movement while the advanced Dynamic mode compensates for camera shake from shooting while walking.\n\nThe iVIS HF M32 features a 3.89-megapixel Full HD CMOS Image Sensor, DIGIC DV III Image Processor, and Genuine Canon HD Video Lens with 15x optical zoom. The model is capable of recording high-resolution HD video at the maximum Advanced Video Codec High Definition (AVCHD)-format bit rate of 24 Mbps, while high-speed Instant AF (Auto Focus) further contributes to outstanding imaging performance.\n\nThe iVIS HF M32 is available in two body color options—silver and black—and, for expanded shooting enjoyment, can be used with two optional accessories: the WP-V2 Waterproof Case, capable of underwater use up to 40 meters, and the SM-V1 5.1-Channel Surround Microphone.",

      "description": "The new Canon XF105 and XF100 incorporate the popular MPEG-2 Full HD (4:2:2) file-based recording codec capability also featured in the XF305 and XF300 released in June 2010, while achieving a significantly smaller and lighter body design. In response to the demands of users, the two new camcorders support a wide range of industry uses, offering the mobility needed for outdoor locations while also enabling shooting in narrow spaces in indoor settings. They also support 3-D video production when using two video camcorders together. In addition, the XF105 incorporates an increased range of connection terminals for enhanced expandability during video production.\n\nThrough the incorporation of a single-CMOS sensor system, a newly designed zoom lens, and high-density mounting technology, the compact, lightweight XF105 and XF100 offer a body size that is approximately 42% the volume of, and a body weight approximately 41% the weight of the XF305 and XF300. The new camcorders include a functional arrangement of such features as the operation panels, terminals and microphone, and an optimized grip design delivering improved weight balance for increased stability and handling that will satisfy professional users.\n\nIn addition to incorporating dual CF card slots that enable highly reliable recording, the new Canon XF105 and XF100 feature MPEG-2 Full HD (MPEG-2 422P@HL compliant) compression, making possible 1,920 x 1,080-pixel Full HD video recording. The new lineup’s 4:2:2 color sampling offers twice the volume of color data when compared to the 4:2:0 profile format used in HDV. In addition, the codec realizes a maximum 50 Mbps data recording, approximately twice the data volume of HDV.\n\nThe Canon XF105 and XF100 deliver high-quality images through the incorporation of a Canon HD CMOS PRO with approximately 2.07-million effective pixels—a sensor also utilized in the XF305 and XF300. Further contributing to its compact body, the new lineup features a newly designed high-resolution, wide-angle 30.4 mm*1 f/1.8 Canon HD Video Lens with 10x optical zoom.\n\nWhen using two units together, the new Canon XF105 and XF100 support 3-D video on-site production. The 3-D video recording system set-up enables users to conveniently make adjustments to axis and zoom positioning, as well as scan reverse, which instantly inverts the display horizontally, vertically, or in both directions.\n\nThe Canon XF105 and XF100 include support for infrared shooting, a feature in wide demand by broadcasters for use in such situations as the observance of nocturnal animals that are difficult to film in normal lighting, as well as documentary television programs. In addition, the duo feature an operation ring for such functions as zoom, focus and iris settings, giving a feel similar to that of mechanical lenses. Tailored to the needs of professional users during multi-camera filming at such locations as live venues, the Canon XF105 features an expanded range of connection terminals, including Genlock*2 and HD/SD SDI terminals.",

      "description": "The new Canon iVIS HF M41 and HF M43 camcorders deliver rich video-recording performance unseen in previous consumer-use models, offering a wide spectrum of enjoyable production possibilities, enabling the capture of day-to-day life as if scenes in a movie or television drama.\n\nIncorporating the same high-performance sensor as the professional-use Canon XF105 HD video camcorder, the iVIS HF M41 and HF M43 feature a 1/3-inch HD CMOS PRO image sensor with approximately 2.07 million effective pixels. With a light-receiving area per pixel measuring approximately 2.6-times larger than the previous model—the iVIS HF32 released in August 2010—the HF M41 and HF M43 enable even more light to be gathered, resulting in higher sensitivity and a wide dynamic range. This feature makes possible improved noise control in light and dark areas and a reduction in the occurrence of over- and under-exposed areas, as well as smooth gradation and natural color reproduction.\n\nIn addition to high-resolution power and optical image stabilization, the iVIS HF M41 and HF M43 feature a newly designed Canon HD video lens with 10x optical zoom and an iris supporting smooth background blur. The models also incorporate a high-performance DIGIC DV III Image Processor enabling the capture of beautiful video at a level on par with professional-level HD camcorders.\n\nFeaturing a range of new creative functions, the Canon iVIS HF M41 and HF M43 enable even more enjoyable video possibilities, including the ability to effortlessly shoot video in a style similar to that used in motion pictures or television programs. The Scenario Mode allows users to select from ten themes and scenarios, following the guidance to create polished videos that appear as though they had been scripted and edited, while Cinema-Look Filters create a cinematic look and feel.\nThe iVIS HF M41 and HF M43 feature a large 3.0-inch Touch Panel LCD, which enables the use of such functions as Touch and Track for precise focus and exposure for a subject selected on the touch panel, and a Face Select feature that allows users to quickly focus on a chosen subject. In addition, with the use of a stylist pen, a Touch Decoration function enables such additions to video as stamps, animations, and free-hand writing and drawing.\nOther advanced features of the Canon iVIS HF M41 and HF M43 include Face-Detection Technology, which can detect and focus on a subject’s face in a fraction of a second, and a Smart Auto mode enabling the effortless shooting of exceptional video by automatically applying optimal settings based on a classification of 38 shooting scenes—an increase of seven scenes over previous models. In addition, the HF M41 and HF M43 include 32GB and 64GB of internal flash memory, respectively, and offer support for SD/SDHC/SDXC memory cards.",

      "description": "The iVIS HF M52 and HF M51 incorporate an enhanced 1/3-inch HD CMOS PRO image sensor with approximately 2.07 million effective pixels, the same high-performance CMOS sensor as the Canon XF105 HD video camcorder used by video-production professionals. The two new HF M-series camcorders feature enhanced microlens and color-filter transmittance and, compared with their predecessors, the iVIS HF M43 and HF M41 (released in February 2011), achieve a 20% increase in sensitivity with a minimum illumination rating of 1.2 lux,* an improvement over the 1.5 lux* rating for the preceding models, making possible the recording of high-quality video even in low-light settings. In addition to realizing smooth gradation and natural color reproduction, the new camcorders achieve a wide dynamic range with a reduced occurrence of over- and under-exposed areas when shooting in high-contrast conditions.\nBoth iVIS HF M-series models feature a Genuine Canon 10x HD Video Lens offering not only high resolving power and optical image stabilization, but also an iris supporting smooth background blur. The HF M52 and HF M51 include a high-performance DIGIC DV III Image Processor and newly incorporate Intelligent IS, which automatically selects optimal image stabilization settings based on the shooting situation, such as during normal conditions, macro shooting, and when using a tripod.\nThe Canon iVIS HF M52 is capable of recording video not only in the conventional AVCHD file format but also in MP4, allowing video to be viewed via such devices as an iPad and iPhone. Furthermore, marking a first for a Canon video camcorder, the HF M52 employs a wireless transfer function making possible the sharing of captured video over a Wi-Fi network directly to such devices as an iPad or iPhone, enabling users to then upload video to such video-sharing sites as YouTube. This feature also allows for data to be transferred to Wi-Fi-connected devices, including PCs or home servers.",

      "description": "The new Canon iVIS HF R42 HD video camcorder newly incorporates a Baby Mode, which enables users to effortlessly capture precious moments and enjoy tracking the growth of infants over time. By registering a baby’s date of birth on the device prior to recording, the HF R42 will automatically add a stamp to indicate the child’s age in the video. Users can also add stamps to display the infant’s length and weight at the time the video was captured. Video files recorded in Baby Mode are automatically saved in chronological order in the camcorder’s Baby Album, enabling videos to be easily managed separate from other video files.\n\nFeaturing enhanced Wi-Fi connectivity, the Canon iVIS HF R42 allows video to be sent wirelessly to cell phones, PCs and other devices, enabling users to easily share video using such methods as e-mail, social networking sites and video-sharing sites.*1 The camcorder enables video to be wirelessly shared using not only iOS devices, but also Android devices, delivering improved ease of use*2 compared with its predecessor, the iVIS HF R32 (released in May 2012), which only supported iOS devices. In addition, by downloading the CameraAccess*3 application, users can monitor video in real-time using a mobile device, even from a remote location. Users can also remotely start and stop recording, control zoom and confirm such camcorder information as remaining battery life, recording time and zoom setting.\n\nThe Canon iVIS HF R42 employs a newly developed DIGIC DV 4 imaging platform that, featuring greatly enhanced processing power, makes possible high image quality and high magnification. DIGIC DV 4 supports 1080/60p*4 recording in both AVCHD and MP4 video formats, approximately twice the information volume of the 60i frame rate standard offered by its predecessor, enabling users to crisply capture even fast moving subjects. The camcorder is capable of recording MP4 files at a bit rate of approximately 35 Mbps, making possible the accurate capture of even the peripheral areas of a moving subject.",

      "description": "The new Canon iVIS HF G20’s 1/3-inch HD CMOS PRO sensor, with approximately 2.07 million effective pixels, features enhanced microlens and color-filter transmittance, making possible a 20% improvement in sensitivity compared with the preceding model, the iVIS HF G10 (released in March 2011). The HF G20 offers a minimum illumination rating of approximately 1.2 lux, an improvement over the approximately 1.5 lux offered by its predecessor, enabling users to capture video in environments with even less available light. In addition, its wide dynamic range reduces the occurrence of over- and under-exposed areas when shooting in high-contrast conditions. The device includes a 10x optical zoom Canon HD Video Lens to realize the same level of optical performance as the professional-use XF105 HD video camcorder (released in January 2011).\n\nWhen capturing a moving subject, the Canon iVIS HF G20’s High-Speed AF function quickly adjusts focus by measuring the distance to the subject. In addition, users can also make use of Medium-Speed AF, which delivers a natural focusing speed. The camcorder includes such functions as Intelligent IS, which automatically selects optimal image stabilization settings based on the shooting situation, and Touch & Track, which allows users to quickly focus on a chosen subject. The iVIS HF G20 is equipped with a lens hood with a lens barrier, which helps minimize unwanted light from entering the lens. Furthermore, the camcorder doesn’t require the use of a lens cap thanks to the inclusion of a built-in lens barrier, which can be opened and closed with the slide of a switch, ensuring users never miss unexpected video opportunities.",

      "description": "Designed for users who enjoy creative hobbies and lifestyles, the Canon iVIS mini delivers shooting style freedom by enabling convenient hands-free place-and-shoot recording and shooting video of oneself.\n\nEquipped with an ultra-wide-angle lens and offering operability that supports hands-free shooting, it not only makes possible the creation of impressive movies documenting indoor performances such as dance routines and musical recitals, as well as cooking, it also provides the ideal means for users to review and check the rehearsals of such performances.\n\nThe iVIS mini’s ultra-wide-angle lens realizes a 170-degree angle of view (35 mm equivalent: 15.4 mm) with an aspect ratio of 4:3 when capturing still images, and a 160-degree angle of view (35 mm equivalent: 16.8 mm) with an aspect ratio of 16:9 when recording video. As such, it enables corner-to-corner coverage when shooting in narrow indoor spaces, such as a studio or café, producing visually impressive movies with an enhanced sense of perspective.\n\nThe iVIS mini’s vari-angle LCD monitor is attached by a parallel two-axis hinge mechanism that facilitates shooting from a variety of angles. When the monitor faces the rear, it can swing up to a maximum angle of 80 degrees, and in the front-facing position, it can be raised up to 90 degrees for self-shooting. Additionally, a built-in stand allows the camcorder to be placed at shooting angles of up to 60 degrees, making hands-free shooting easier than ever.\n\nFeaturing the HS System, which combines an approximately 12.8-megapixel high-sensitivity CMOS sensor and the high-performance DIGIC DV4 imaging platform, the iVIS mini captures high-resolution movies and still images with low noise, even when shooting in low-light settings.\nIn addition to high-quality video, the iVIS mini achieves high-quality audio thanks to a built-in stereo microphone. Furthermore, with Audio Scene Select, users can choose from a variety of audio modes for the sound frequency response and microphone directional characteristic ideally suited to each shooting situation. Audio Scene Select ensures high-quality sound when shooting musical performances while suppressing unwanted road noise when shooting during drives.\n\nCanon’s iVIS mini includes a Mirror Image function that horizontally reverses the orientation of the image during recording and playback to provide users with an effective way of checking their movements for such activities as dance performances or practicing their golf swing.\n\nFeaturing built-in Wi-Fi,*1 the iVIS mini also enables the uploading of recorded movies to SNS sites*2 as well as live streaming and remote shooting using a smartphone or tablet device.*3",

Additionally, through the efficient use of the effective imaging area, the magnification of the VIXIA HF R52/R50/R500’s Advanced Zoom has been expanded from the 53x zoom of its predecessor to a maximum zoom of 57x.\n\nThe VIXIA HF R52/R50/R500’s newly enhanced Baby Mode offers such features as the ability to include a stamp showing the age of the infant being recorded. While the VIXIA HF R42/R40/R400 were able to register only one infant, the VIXIA HF R52/R50/R500 let users register up to three children, so that once the birthday of each brother or sister has been entered, the camcorder automatically computes the proper age for each child.\n\nBecause Canon’s VIXIA HF R52/R50 make possible the streaming and recording of live images over the Internet,*3 users can monitor their pets at home from work or check on the conditions in a room even when away.",

      "description": "The XC10 makes use of the Intra Frame 4K video compression format, which achieves a maximum 305 Mbps (Megabits per second) bit rate, delivering a high data-compression rate without sacrificing image quality to contribute to reduced data volume. Furthermore, the 4K camcorder includes the same video recording formats as those employed in the Company’s Cinema EOS System lineup of professional digital cinematography products, making possible stunning video results with minimal overexposure and underexposure even in extremely bright and dark areas of the imaging area. The XC10 is also equipped with a slot for CFast 2.0 memory cards, a high-speed data-storage medium that enables the recording of 4K video without an external storage device.\n\nSupporting the capture of high-resolution still images, the Canon XC10 incorporates an approximately 12.0-megapixel 1.0-inch CMOS sensor delivering a maximum ISO speed of 20000, and a mechanical shutter that eliminates rolling shutter skew even when capturing subjects moving at high speed. Furthermore, the 4K camcorder includes a 4K Frame Grab, which allows users to extract approximately 8.29-megapixel photographs from 4K video recorded at 30 frames per second.\n\nThe XC10 employs an LCD monitor capable of tilting upwards by approximately 90 degrees and downwards by approximately 65 degrees, and a grip that can be rotated on its axis by approximately 90 degrees both upwards and downwards. The XC10’s design allows users to shoot from a variety of perspectives and angles, supporting the capture of video in situations where a high level of mobility is essential.",

Featuring enhanced light-condensing efficiency, the new sensor makes possible an S/N ratio that has been improved by 3 dB and an approximately 40 percent reduction in noise compared with the XA25 and XA20. The two camcorders combine the HD CMOS PRO sensor with an impressive 20x optical zoom lens and Canon’s DIGIC DV 4 imaging platform to achieve smooth, high-quality video with minimal noise, even when shooting in dimly lit environments.\n\nEnabling a wide range of imaging possibilities, the new Highlight Priority video-recording mode*2 makes possible the faithful imaging expression of visual characteristics that would otherwise be lost due to video compression, facilitating the capture of video that realistically conveys*3 such qualities as the three-dimensional feel of blue skies and clouds, the translucence of water and the luster of metals.\n\nFurthermore, drawing from technologies employed in Canon’s Cinema EOS System lineup of professional digital cinematography products, the new Wide DR mode achieves a dynamic range that has been expanded to 600 percent from the predecessor’s 300 percent. The mode minimizes the occurrence of under- and over-exposed areas while making possible video with smooth color gradations, even when shooting in environments that tend to produce under- and over-exposed regions, such as those with drastic differences in lighting conditions.",

      "description": "Successors to the entry-level iVIS HF R62 (released in February 2015), the new Canon iVIS HF R72 and iVIS HF R700*1 allow users to easily capture high-image-quality video. Additionally, the two models are the first video camcorders to feature a Highlight Priority recording mode, which facilitates the faithful expression of tonal gradations, colors and sharpness in the mid- to high-brightness range.\n\nIn addition to the recording modes offered in the preceding model, the new iVIS HF R72 and HF R700 newly include the Highlight Priority recording mode featured in the XA35 and XA30 professional-model camcorders (released in December 2015). Highlight Priority makes possible the capture of highly saturated, realistic colors and conveys gradation characteristics as perceived by the eye. By reducing the mid- to high-brightness compression of the standard gamma mode, the mode helps to prevent loss of detail in high brightness areas, facilitating the capture of video that realistically conveys*2 such qualities as the three-dimensional feel of blue skies and clouds, the translucence of water and the luster of metals.\n\nThe duo ships with a large-capacity battery capable of maintaining a charge lasting approximately 1.5 times that of the battery included with their predecessor. Accordingly, the battery lets users enjoy continuous shooting for up to approximately 165 minutes.",

Placing the greatest emphasis on image quality, the D6000 is aimed at the top of the professional digital market for advertising and artistic photography.\nThe camera and digital sections have been integrated, resulting in a much more compact and better handling unit. The new 6 megapixel CCD gives much better color reproduction. It is the world’s highest-resolution digital field camera using a single CCD at the time. Mode setting and dial operations are the same as the EOS-1N, and uses the entire, very extensive lineup of interchangeable EF lenses, making switching from film to digital a snap for EOS users. Immediately after exposure the image can be checked on the 1.8″ color LCD monitor, located on the back of the camera. Continuous shooting at one fps for up to three frames, and quick, accurate, natural-looking E-TTL automatic flash exposures with EX Speedlites are possible.\nTwo PCMCIA card slots accept two Type I or Type II cards, or one Type III card. The next generation IEEE1394 interface is used for high-speed data transfer.",

      "description": "The EOS D30 is a new popularly priced digital SLR camera with a large-area 3.25 million pixel CMOS Imaging Sensor that accepts all the myriad lenses in the EF series. It is designed for serious amateurs, business and professional photographers. It could be called the “Next Generation Standard Digital SLR”. With high image quality and a multitude of functions, the price is a very reasonable 358,000 yen.\n\nThe D30’s imaging sensor is a large 3.25 mega pixel CMOS sensor, with a primary color RGB filter, and a newly developed digital signal processing LSI (Image Engine), to insure high image resolution and excellent color balance. Canon’s unique noise reduction technology produces significant effect for the long time release images such as night scenes. Operational components and controls are from the EOS series so EF lenses, Speedlites and other EOS accessories can be used. The EOS user can use the D30 just as he uses his EOS film cameras. The stainless steel chassis is both light and strong and combined with the high-strength engineering plastic covers gives it a light, strong, rigid body, the smallest in the class (as of August 2000).\n\nMajor specifications of the D30 include three selectable focusing points, multiple shooting modes including five easy-to-use Image Select modes, 35-zone Evaluative metering, built-in retractable flash with E-TTL capability, an EOS system first, and continuous photography at approximately 3fps for up to eight frames (Large/Fine). While viewing pictures or performing menu operations, you can return immediately to the shooting mode simply by pressing the shutter button halfway. This is called shooting priority camera design. In addition to allowing immediate playback of images captured, the built-in 1.8″ LCD color monitor on the rear of the camera also displays shutter speed, working aperture, metering mode and other information including a histogram graph of the brightness of a selected image.\n\nThe image-recording medium is a CompactFlash (CF) card. Its excellent features include easy expansion of storage capacity, robustness and reliability. When a 16MB type CF card bundled with the EOS D30 is used, approximately 10 frames can be taken (Large/Fine). In addition to the standard 16MB card, 8, 30, 48,64 and 128MB cards are available. D30 is bundled with various application software which accommodates vast customer from sophisticated PC user to the beginners. The EOS D30 is also compatible with CF Type II, so high capacity storage media such as the IBM Microdrive can be used. The EOS D30 uses a high-capacity Battery Pack BP-511 (rechargeable lithium-ion battery) to provide stable operation for approximately 540 exposures (fully charged battery and 50% flash use). The Battery Grip BG-ED3 (sold separately) can accommodate two BP-511 Battery Packs to further extend the camera’s shooting capacity.",

The technology ensures that professionals never miss a decisive shot, and that users can be assured of a consistently stable viewfinder image during continuous shooting.\n\nThe camera features a lightweight, heavy-duty magnesium alloy exterior, and thorough water- and dust-resistant sealing on all switches and body seams.\n\nThe EOS-1D has also cleared the stringent 150,000 shot operational durability trial, and ensures users of unfailing reliability under even the most grueling conditions.\n\nThe latest and most advanced addition to Canon’s range of professional digital SLRs, the EOS-1D inherits and expands on many of the innovative functions and applications possessed by the EOS-1V. These include the company’s proprietary 45-point area autofocus, which eliminates the need to position the subject at the center of the picture to facilitate instant shooting and dynamic image photography, a 21-Zone Evaluative metering sensor to ensure ideal exposure performance, an advanced full-frame viewfinder and Custom Function control, allowing users to tailor camera operations to their individual preferences.",

      "description": "The EOS D60 digital SLR camera succeeds and greatly expands on the acclaimed EOS D30 released in October 2000, enabling a broad range of applications to meet the needs of high-end amateur and business users.\n\nThe EOS D60’s imaging element comprises a newly developed 6.3-megapixel large-area (22.7 x 15.1mm effective size in a 3:2 aspect ratio) high-resolution CMOS sensor, an RGB primary color filter, and Canon’s proprietary high-speed “imaging engine” signal-processing IC for a high signal-to-noise ratio, detailed images and faithful color reproduction.\n\nEven though the EOS D60 ranks in the 6-megapixel-camera class, Canon’s CMOS sensor permits a broad range of ISO-equivalent sensitivity settings from the default ISO 100 up to a maximum ISO 1000.\n\nFeedback received from EOS D30 users gave many suggestions for improving on the features of the D30. These excellent new features include simultaneous recording of both RAW and JPEG images, development parameters that can be set and registered on the camera, and new custom functions which bring the total to 14 custom functions.",

      "description": "The EOS 10D digital SLR camera inherits and expands on the advanced features of the EOS D60, offering enhanced digital-performance and improved shooting features to meet the needs of high-end amateur users.\n\nThe model’s imaging element comprises a Canon-developed 6.3-megapixel large-area (22.7 x 15.1mm effective size in a 3:2 aspect ratio) high-resolution CMOS sensor, an RGB primary color filter, and Canon’s newly developed DIGIC Imaging Engine, which makes possible enhanced image-processing speed and precision. These advanced features combine to realize increased image quality and definition, and more natural color reproduction compared with the EOS D60. Advanced shooting features include a high-speed 7-point wide area autofocus (AF) with focusing points superimposed in the viewfinder, making accurate framing simple. Featuring Canon’s proprietary AF sensor, the EOS 10D utilizes a high-speed microprocessor, an orientation sensor, and an improved AF algorithm to boost speed and subject-tracking performance, ensuring that even off-center and fast moving subjects are captured sharply.\n\nThe new camera offers enhanced continuous-shooting performance, capturing approximately three frames per second for a burst of up to nine shots, regardless of the recording format, ISO setting or subject conditions. Canon has achieved new advances in its CMOS sensor technology to make possible longer exposures with less degradation in image quality for an extended range of ISO-equivalent speed settings from ISO 100 to ISO 1600. Moreover, the new camera offers an “ISO Expansion” menu setting that permits users to select a maximum speed of ISO 3200.",

      "description": "The EOS Kiss Digital incorporates a Canon-developed 6.3-megapixel large-area (22.7 x 15.1 mm effective size in a 3:2 aspect ratio) high-resolution CMOS sensor and Canon’s exclusive DIGIC Image Processor, which realizes exceeding image-processing speed and precision to fully utilize the performance potential of the sensor. This advanced technology works in concert to realize outstanding image quality and definition, and more natural color reproduction to satisfy the requirements of a broad user base.\n\nThe EOS Kiss Digital offers advanced shooting features, including a high-speed 7-point wide area autofocus (AF) with focusing points superimposed in the viewfinder, making accurate framing simple; Continuous Shooting at approximately 2.5 frames per second for a burst of up to four shots; and the ability to record JPEG images in one of six formats or as a 12-bit RAW file. Moreover, when a RAW image is captured the EOS Kiss Digital simultaneously records and stores a JPEG image (Medium/Fine) within the RAW data, enabling users to view or transmit the compressed JPEG image quickly while also retaining maximum image quality for future editing.\n\nEmploying high-density mounting technology and a new chassis and outer-casing configuration with fewer parts, the Canon EOS Kiss Digital realizes the smallest and lightest body in the EOS DIGITAL series, measuring just 142 (w) x 99 (h) x 72.4 mm (d) and weighing only 560g. In addition to compact proportions, the camera’s design contributes to outstanding usability, concentrating such operating controls as the mode dial and electronic dial on the right-hand side for one-handed operation of most shooting functions. Moreover, for the first time in the series, the EOS Kiss Digital incorporates a cross-configured control-button layout that works with a simple “tab” style menu layout to enable easy control of shooting, playback and camera settings without having to scroll.\n\nThe EOS Kiss Digital is compatible with the PictBridge industry standard for the direct printing of photos from digital cameras. As a result, users can connect the camera directly to any printer enabled for PictBridge, regardless of brand, and output photos (JPEG) without having to use a computer.",

      "description": "The EOS-1D Mark II, replacing the EOS-1D model released in December 2001, was designed to meet the rigorous demands of professional news, sports and studio photographers. The EOS-1D Mark II incorporates a large APS-H-size (28.7 x 19.1 mm) CMOS sensor with 8.2-million effective pixels and, maximizing the performance potential of the sensor, Canon’s new proprietary DIGIC II high-speed digital signal-processing integrated circuit. The DIGIC II circuit performs detailed processing of large-volume data at extremely high speed, satisfying professional demands for superlative image quality and responsiveness in any shooting situation.\nIn response to requests from professional users, Canon has included a range of new features in the EOS-1D Mark II, including a greater choice of image-quality settings, with four JPEG sizes and ten compression levels in addition to RAW files. Additionally, two customizable color-matrix settings, in addition to five preset modes, enable image optimization according to the requirements of the subject or output device. Moreover, dedicated card slots for CompactFlash and SD memory cards enable simultaneous backup or selective recording to either card, while a video output terminal enables users to view images on a television screen. The model also incorporates a two-inch 230,000-dots LCD monitor which, doubling the resolution of the previous model’s, enables magnification up to 10x to effectively check image focus during playback.\n\nThe EOS-1D Mark II offers outstanding resilience, boasting improvements such as dramatically increased shutter durability capable of withstanding 200,000 cycles. A lightweight, heavy-duty magnesium alloy exterior provides exceeding rigidity as well as electromagnetic shielding, while thorough water- and dust-resistant sealing in 70 locations, including all switches, body seams and memory-card slots, ensures users of unfailing reliability under even the most grueling conditions. Incorporating an AF system with a high-speed split-multiprocessor architecture, the EOS-1D Mark II realizes improved AF performance. In addition to matching the camera’s 8.5 fps continuous-shooting speed, the camera delivers One-Shot AF speed and AI Servo AF focusing precision superior to those of the EOS-1D. The camera also features Canon’s new E-TTL II automatic flash exposure control which, used with Canon’s EX-series Speedlite flashes, employs a revised metering algorithm to achieve more precise, stable exposure control.\nThe latest and most advanced addition to Canon’s range of professional digital SLRs, the EOS-1D Mark II inherits the renowned functions and usability of the EOS-1D and EOS-1Ds. These include the company’s proprietary 45-point area autofocus, which makes photo composition quick and easy by eliminating the need to position the subject at the center of the picture; a 21-Zone Evaluative metering sensor to ensure ideal exposure performance; an advanced full-frame viewfinder; and Custom Function control, which allows users to tailor camera operations to their individual preferences.\nFurther catering to the needs of pro users, the new camera ships with a software suite that includes Canon’s newly developed high-speed RAW-image-processing application, Digital Photo Professional. The newly developed application incorporates input from professional users, including high-speed image previews, a multi-frame editing window and batch processing, to boost workflow efficiency when working with large quantities of RAW images. Also included among the bundled software is the all-purpose EOS Viewer Utility which, based on Canon’s previous File Viewer Utility, features such improvements as high-speed RAW-image previews and a refined user-interface for enhanced operability.",

      "description": "Canon’s EOS 20D, targeted at professional and high-end amateur users, represents a new generation of digital SLR camera. Inheriting and expanding on the exceptional functionality of the EOS 10D, released in March 2003, the new EOS 20D reaches new heights in both image quality and camera responsiveness. The EOS 20D incorporates a newly developed large APS-C-size (22.5 x 15.0 mm) CMOS sensor with 8.2-million effective pixels and,maximizing the performance potential of the sensor, Canon’s new proprietary DIGIC II image engine. The DIGIC II image engine performs detailed processing of large-volume data at extremely high speeds, satisfying demands for high image quality and definition, natural color reproduction, and responsiveness from advanced-amateur and professional users alike. Coupling superlative image quality with speed, the EOS 20D enables continuous shooting of high-quality (JPEG large/fine) images at around 5 fps for up to 23 consecutive shots. Further contributing to stress-free use is a fast startup time of just 0.2 seconds, a maximum shutter speed of 1/8000 second, and the high-speed writing of image files to the CompactFlash card media. Also, a USB 2.0 Hi-Speed external interface combines with the DIGIC II image engine and enhanced digital circuitry to enable file transfers at up to ten times previous transfer speeds.\nAdvanced shooting features include a high-speed 9-point wide-area autofocus (AF) with focusing points superimposed in the viewfinder that make accurate framing simple. Enabling ideal white balance performance and a range of effects equivalent to Canon’s flagship EOS-1D Mark II, the new EOS 20D offers six lighting presets (Daylight, Shade, Cloudy, Tungsten light, Fluorescent light, and Flash), three freely settable Custom Modes, and a Color Temperature setting, in addition to an enhanced-performance Auto Mode.\n\nOther features contributing to the EOS 20D’s boosted shooting functionality include: expanded processing parameters enabling black-and-white image conversion; compatibility with the entire range of Canon EF lenses, including EF-S models; and Canon’s E-TTL II flash metering system which, when used with Canon’s EX-series Speedlite flashes, utilizes distance information provided through the lens for more precise and stable direct-flash exposure than ever before.\nThe Canon EOS 20D features magnesium-alloy body covers for exceeding rigidity and durability, while a total design revision and reduction in the overall number of parts used has resulted in smaller body dimensions. Compared with the EOS 10D, the new camera’s width, height and depth are around 5.7, 2.0 and 3.5 mm smaller, respectively, while weightsavings amount to 105 g, for easier handling. Moreover, the camera’s back panel features a new easy-to-use “multi-controller,” enabling users to control camera settings -including white balance correction and bracketing, AF point selection and, when direct printing, the image trimming frame – with a minimum of effort.\nCanon’s new EOS 20D digital SLR camera offers an extensive range of optional accessories to extend camera performance, including the Battery Grip BG-E2. Accepting up to two Nickel-Metal Hydride (Ni-MH) batteries, the battery grip provides users with enough power to capture up to around 2,000 images. The unit also features a vertical-hold grip with auxiliary shutter release for easy shooting in both a vertical or horizontal position. Moreover, in response to user demand, the BG-E2 accepts six AA-size alkaline batteries, allowing users to take advantage of this readily available energy source. Also, offering compatibility with the PictBridge industry standard for direct photo printing, the EOS 20D enables users to connect the camera directly to any PictBridge-enabled printer, regardless of brand, and print out photos (JPEG) without having to use a computer.",

      "description": "The Canon EOS-1Ds Mark II, replacing the 11.1-megapixel EOS-1Ds, is a professional digital AF SLR camera developed primarily to meet the needs of portrait and studio photographers, who demand the highest image quality. Featuring a newly developed full-frame 35 mm CMOS sensor (36 x 24 mm) boasting 16.7 million effective pixels, the world’s highest pixel count among digital SLR cameras*, the EOS-1Ds Mark II realizes superlative image resolution, rich color gradation and a wide ISO sensitivity range (ISO 100-1,600, L:50, H: 3,200). The 35 mm sensor size also allows users to fully utilize the angles of view offered by the entire range of Canon EF lenses**, permitting unrestricted lens performance for a shooting feel on par with film SLR cameras.\nThe EOS-1Ds Mark II incorporates Canon’s proprietary DIGIC II image engine to maximize the performance potential of the CMOS image sensor. Performing detailed processing of large-volume data at extremely high speeds, the DIGIC II image engine realizes the ultra-fine detail and natural color reproduction demanded by professional users. Also enabling outstanding responsiveness, DIGIC II makes possible continuous shooting of high-quality (JPEG large) images at up to four frames per second for up to 32 consecutive shots, the high-speed writing of image files to the card media, and a fast startup time of just 0.3 seconds.\n\nCanon’s EOS-1Ds Mark II professional digital SLR camera offers a range of new features, including a greater choice of image-quality settings, with four JPEG sizes and ten compression levels in addition to a RAW file setting. Additionally, two customizable color-matrix settings, in addition to five preset modes, enable image optimization according to the requirements of the subject or output device. Moreover, dedicated card slots for CompactFlash and SD memory cards enable simultaneous backup or selective recording to either card, while a video output terminal enables users to view images on a television screen. The model also incorporates a two-inch 230,000 dots LCD monitor which, nearly doubling the resolution of that offered by the previous model, enables magnification up to 10x to effectively check image focus during playback.\nThe EOS-1Ds Mark II offers outstanding resilience, boasting improvements such as dramatically increased shutter durability capable of withstanding 200,000 cycles. A lightweight, heavy-duty magnesium alloy exterior provides exceeding rigidity as well as electromagnetic shielding, while thorough water- and dust-resistant sealing in 70 locations, including all switches, body seams and memory-card slots, ensures users of unfailing reliability under even the most grueling conditions.\nOther advanced features include a maximum shutter speed of 1/8000 second; Canon’s proprietary 45-point area autofocus, which makes photo composition quick and easy by eliminating the need to position the subject at the center of the picture; a 21-Zone Evaluative metering sensor to ensure ideal exposure performance; an advanced full-frame viewfinder; and Custom Function control, which allows users to tailor camera operations to their individual preferences. Moreover, the new EOS-1Ds Mark II features Canon’s E-TTL II flash metering system which, when used with the company’s EX-series Speedlite flashes, utilizes distance information provided through the lens for more precise and stable direct-flash exposure than ever before.",

      "description": "Canon’s EOS Kiss Digital N is the successor to the immensely popular EOS Kiss Digital, which has sold around 1.2 million units*1 worldwide since its debut in September 2003. Based on the development concepts of high image quality, responsiveness, and ease of use, the new EOS Kiss Digital N, realizing the smallest body in the EOS Digital series, is also the world’s lightest among digital SLR cameras*2. The model also incorporates revolutionary advances in image quality, design, functionality and cost performance.\n\nThe EOS Kiss Digital N features a Canon-developed large single-plate CMOS sensor with approximately 8.0 million effective pixels and an image size measuring 22.2 x 14.8 mm (APS-C size). Coupled with Canon’s exclusive DIGIC II image engine, which achieves super high-speed processing of large-volume data, the camera delivers high-definition, high-quality image processing and natural color rendition to satisfy the demands of a broad user base.\n\nThe EOS Kiss Digital N backs outstanding image quality with high responsiveness to ensure that no photo opportunity is lost. The camera achieves a continuous shooting speed of approximately 3.0 frames per second for up to around 14 consecutive frames (JPEG L, Fine) in a sequence and realizes an ultra-fast startup of just 0.2 seconds. The model writes images to the CompactFlash card media at more than three times the speed of its predecessor, the EOS Kiss Digital, and includes a Hi-Speed USB 2.0 interface, enabling high-speed data transfer to a PC.\n\nThe latest addition to Canon’s digital SLR camera lineup features a high-speed 7-point wide area autofocus (AF) with focusing points superimposed in the viewfinder for easy framing. It also incorporates new white balance functions, such as WB correction, permitting users to adjust for blue, amber, magenta or green hues; and WB bracketing, which enables shots to be taken in the magenta-green direction as well as the blue-amber direction. Additionally, the model’s wide range of processing parameters include a new monochrome mode that makes black and white photography easier than ever.\n\nThe EOS Kiss Digital N is compatible with Canon’s E-TTL II auto-flash system. When using one of the EX-series Speedlite lineup, E-TTL II utilizes distance information and other data provided through the lens to deliver stable flash-brightness control that minimizes the impact of changes in subject brightness, reflectivity and framing.\n\nA convenient cross-key layout on the back of the camera enables direct access to the four most commonly used functions–AF mode, metering mode, white balance, and ISO speed–and a large main switch and easy-set mode dial offer simple right-handed operation that takes users quickly from startup to shooting. The camera also includes an Easy Print button which, when connected to one of Canon’s Direct Print-enabled photo printers or other PictBridge-compatible printers, allows users to easily print out high-quality photos without a PC.\n\nThe EOS Kiss Digital N employs a new compact battery, a smaller chassis, core components that are optimized to the sensor size, and consolidated circuit boards for fewer overall parts. As a result, the Kiss Digital N realizes the smallest and lightest body in the EOS digital SLR camera series, measuring just 126.5 (w) x 94.2 (h) x 64.0 mm (d) and weighing a mere 485 grams, distinguishing the model as the world’s lightest digital SLR camera*2. Even when fitted with the new Canon EF-S18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 II USM zoom lens and the compact, lightweight battery pack NB-2LH, the EOS Kiss Digital N realizes an outstandingly portable system that weighs just 715 grams.\n\nThe new EOS camera offers users a choice of stylish body colors*3 –Titanium Silver and Satin Black–and can be used with a range of EOS camera accessories, including Speedlite and Macrolite flashes. A dedicated battery grip, the Battery Grip BG-E3, is also available for the model to allow long periods of continuous shooting using up to two NB-2LH batteries or AA batteries.",

      "description": "Inheriting and expanding on the exceptional functionality of the EOS-1D Mark II, released in April 2004, the Canon EOS-1D Mark II N reaches new heights in both functionality and camera responsiveness. The camera incorporates a large APS-H-size (28.7 x 19.1 mm) CMOS sensor with 8.2-million effective pixels and, maximizing the performance potential of the sensor, Canon’s proprietary DIGIC II high-speed imaging processor. Designed to meet the rigorous demands of professional news, sports and studio photographers, the EOS-1D Mark II N delivers the world’s highest* continuous shooting speed of approximately 8.5 frames per second for up to a maximum 48 consecutive frames** in a sequence.\nCanon’s EOS-1D Mark II N features a revolutionary new Picture Style function which consolidates and advances the processing parameters and color matrix settings. Users can achieve optimized images by simply selecting from six preset settings –Standard, Portrait, Landscape, Neutral, Faithful, and Monochrome– to match their shooting objectives, just as they would select the type of film according to the desired effect. Compared with previous models, the new function offers approximately double the adjustment range for sharpness, contrast, color saturation and color tone. Picture Style will also be incorporated in future Canon digital SLR cameras to ensure unified and consistent image characteristics across the EOS digital lineup.\nThe EOS-1D Mark II N sports a large 2.5″ LCD monitor with approximately 230,000 dots and a wide 170-degree viewing angle for optimum visibility during playback. Moreover, the camera offers such improved image playback functions as a magnified view to almost pixel-equivalent-scale from any selected AF point, enabling users to quickly check the focus before taking a shot. Users can also check the focus with a magnified view immediately after shooting using the Quick Review function.\nIn response to requests from professional users, Canon has included a host of new features in the EOS-1D Mark II N, including more complete information displays, simultaneous split recording of RAW/JPEG images, an automatic new-folder-creation function, and automatic noise reduction for long-exposures. Additionally, a new precision-matte focusing screen that enables the user to more easily pick the point of sharpest focus is available as an option.\n\n",

      "description": "Inheriting and expanding on the exceptional functionality of the EOS 20D, released in September 2004, the new Canon EOS 30D reaches new heights in both functionality and camera responsiveness to meet the high-performance demands of a wide range of not only advanced amateur users, but also novice photographers looking to upgrade their skills. The 30D incorporates a Canon-produced APS-C-size Canon’s proprietary CMOS sensor with 8.2-million effective pixels, Canon’s proprietary DIGIC II high-speed image engine, and high-precision 9-point AF (center f/2.8). The camera also boasts a maximum continuous shooting speed of 5 frames per second for up to 30 consecutive frames* in a sequence, increased from the previous maximum of 23 consecutive frames with the EOS 20D.\n\nThe EOS 30D also features Canon’s Picture Style, which consolidates and advances the processing parameters and color matrix settings for optimal picture composition. Users can achieve optimized images simply by selecting the best Picture Style setting for the subject or for their particular style of shooting, just as they would select the type of film according to the desired effect.\n\nMoreover, Canon’s new digital SLR camera incorporates an advanced energy-reduction design to enhance battery performance, realizing up to around 750 shots between battery charges, based on the CIPA standard.\n\nThe Canon EOS 30D realizes improved connectivity with printing devices, particularly the concurrently introduced Canon PIXMA Pro9500/Pro9000 inkjet printers and A2-model imagePROGRAF iPF5000 large-format inkjet printer, which are geared for professional and advanced amateur users. The camera ships with Canon’s high-speed RAW-image-processing application Digital Photo Professional 2.1, which offers seamless compatibility with the Easy-PhotoPrint Pro software for the Pro9500/Pro9000 printer models and imagePROGRAF Print Plug-In for Digital Photo Professional software included with the iPF5000, to provide more comprehensive support for the efficient and faithful printing of RAW images.\n\nOther advanced features of Canon’s new EOS 30D include extended Direct Print functions, a 2.5-inch high-resolution 230,000 dots LCD monitor with a wide viewing angle, and an impressive shutter durability of 100,000 cycles in combination with a maximum shutter speed of 1/8000 second.",

      "description": "The new Canon EOS 40D is the successor model to the EOS 30D, which won market acclaim for its functionality and ease of use following its release in March 2006. Through the incorporation of state-of-the-art camera technologies, the EOS 40D offers high-level amateur users even more advanced functionality and responsiveness.\n\nThe EOS 40D combines a newly developed Canon proprietary APS-C-size (22.2 x 14.8 mm) CMOS sensor with approximately 10.1 million effective pixels and the high-performance DIGIC III image processor to deliver high resolution imaging performance and a rich tonal range. Offering users ISO speed settings ranging from 100 to 1600 and expandable to up to 3200, the model realizes low noise despite supporting high ISO sensitivity. In addition, the EOS 40D boasts a number of other innovations that significantly strengthen its core performance: high-speed continuous shooting of up to approximately 6.5 frames per second for up to 75 continuousframes in large/fine JPEG mode, high-precision all-point cross 9-point AF, and a newly designed viewfinder that provides improved visibility with an approximately 0.95x zoom ratio.\n\nThe Canon EOS 40D incorporates a range of advanced functions that offer levels of operability and ease of use approaching those of top-of-the-line digital SLR cameras. The Live View shooting function allows users to check images in real-time on the camera’s large 3.0-inch LCD monitor while shooting. The camera also enables users to change focusing screens, supporting a diverse range of shooting styles.\n\nMoreover, the EOS Integrated Cleaning System sensor dust solution improves image quality not only with its Self Cleaning Sensor Unit, but also by collecting dust position data so that users can restore dust images even after photographing. The lightweight, high-rigidity magnesium alloy exterior and the shutter, durable for over 100,000 operations with maximum speed of 1/8000 second, further ensure a high degree of reliability.\n\nThe EOS 40D is compatible with Canon’s comprehensive range of EF interchangeable lenses, including the popular EF-S17-85mm f/4-5.6 IS USM, as well as the two new Canon EF-S-series Image Stabilizer-equipped lenses that were also launched today: the EF-S18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 IS standard zoom lens and the EF-S55-250mm f/4-5.6 IS telephoto lens.\n\nCanon also announced today that concurrently with the EOS 40D it will release the Wireless File Transmitter WFT-E3, enabling users to transfer images to a server or computer via wireless or wired LAN. Offering USB hosting functions to connect to external media and a convenient vertically oriented grip, the WFT-E3 effectively fulfills a wide variety of photographic applications.",

      "description": "EOS-1Ds Mark III, replacing the 16.7-megapixel EOS-1Ds Mark II, is a professional digital SLR camera designed to meet the rigorous demands of professional portrait, merchandise, and landscape photographers.\n\nIncorporating Canon’s 35 mm full-frame, 21.1-megapixel CMOS sensor, the EOS-1Ds Mark III realizes an exceptional level of image quality through its high image resolution, low noise, and rich color gradation, supporting an ISO range from 100 up to 1600.*1 The 35 mm sensor size allows users to fully utilize the angles of view offered by all Canon EF lenses,*2 allowing for unrestricted lens performance and a shooting feel on par with that of film SLR cameras.\n\nIn addition, the EOS-1Ds Mark III is equipped with the dual DIGIC III high-end image-processing system, enabling processing of even higher resolution image data at a speed approximately 4 times faster than the previous model. The technology also makes possible a continuous shooting speed of approximately 5 frames per second for up to 56 large JPEG images or up to 12 RAW images in a sequence. The model further realizes outstanding functionality by employing a high-speed, high-precision Area AF sensor of 19 cross-type points (f/2.8 or faster lenses) plus 26 assist points (f/5.6 or faster lenses), and a newly developed high-performance viewfinder that achieves 100% coverage and 0.76x magnification, the highest viewfinder magnification in its class.*3\n\nThe EOS-1Ds Mark III caters to the needs of pro users by offering outstanding resilience, boasting a shutter capable of withstanding 300,000 cycles. The combination of dust- and water-resistant EF lenses and accessories and Canon’s EOS Integrated Cleaning System, a complete dust reduction system, enables the camera to deliver unfailing performance under even the most grueling conditions.\n\nExpanding upon the highly acclaimed functions of the EOS-1D Mark III launched in May 2007, the EOS-1Ds Mark III also incorporates such high-end features as a refined user interface featuring two Live View modes, which offer enhanced performance for studio photographers, and a large 3.0-inch LCD monitor, as well as a variety of system accessories to provide for a wide range of professional photography needs.

      "description": "The Canon EOS Kiss X2 is the latest model in the popular EOS Kiss Digital series, which has captured a broad share of the digital SLR market through its leading-edge technology and high cost-performance.\n\nCombining a newly developed APS-C-size (22.2 x 14.8 mm) 12.2-million effective pixel CMOS sensor with Canon's proprietary DIGIC III high-performance imaging processor, the EOS Kiss X2 delivers both superior imaging resolution and a rich tonal range, while realizing outstanding photographic performance across a wide ISO sensitivity range from 100 to 1600. The model's performance is further improved by its enhanced overall responsiveness, surpassing previous models with a top-of-class continuous shooting speed of up to approximately 3.5 frames per second for as many as 53 consecutive shots* as well as a high-speed, high-precision 9-point AF with a center point sensitive to f/2.8.\n\nThe EOS Kiss X2 is the first EOS Kiss Digital-series model to incorporate Live View, enabling users to shoot while verifying image framing, focus, and exposure in real-time on the camera's 3.0-inch widescreen LCD monitor. The monitor's larger size and wide viewing angle also add to ease-of-use by providing optimal visibility and facilitating shooting using Live View. Users who prefer composing shots through the viewfinder will benefit from its 0.87x magnification ratio—the highest in its class—and improved brightness.\n\nAs an added convenience, because the EOS Kiss X2 records image data on SD memory cards, the format used by many compact digital cameras, users upgrading from a compact model can continue to use the memory cards they already own.\n\nEOS KISS X2's compact body, based on the Curvature Design approach, features fluid curved surfaces, creating a sense of familiarity and chic sophistication. Further adding to the camera’s mobility and convenience is its compact, lightweight body, which weighs in at a mere 475 grams, 35 grams lighter than previous models. Additionally, the EOS KISS X2’s newly developed LP-E5 lithium ion battery pack realizes a capacity 1.5 times that of conventional batteries, increasing the number of photos that can be shot before recharging.\n\nLike its predecessor, the EOS KISS X2 incorporates Canon's EOS Integrated Cleaning System. In addition to employing materials and a construction that help prevent the buildup of dust inside the camera, the system includes a Self Cleaning Sensor Unit that uses ultrasonic vibrations to shake off any dust that may accumulate on the low pass filter in front of the image sensor. The EOS KISS X2 is compatible with Canon’s EF lineup of over 60 lens models, including the EF-S18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 IS and EF-S55-250mm f/4-5.6 IS image stabilization-equipped lenses included in the lens kit packages.",

      "description": "The Canon EOS Kiss F was designed with the aim of enabling a wide range of users to experience the enjoyment of SLR photography, as reflected in the “F” in the camera’s product name, which stands for “Family” as well as “Friendly.” The model embodies the development concepts of the EOS series — “speed, ease of use and high image quality,” along with “compact and lightweight” — while pursuing increased levels of user friendliness.\n\nIncorporating an APS-C size (22.2 x 14.8 mm) CMOS sensor with approximately 10.1 million effective pixels and Canon’s exclusive high-performance DIGIC III image processor, the EOS Kiss F delivers high levels of imaging performance and responsiveness. Also, weighing only around 450 grams, it realizes the lightest body in the EOS Digital series camera lineup.\n\nA variety of advanced features contribute to enhanced operation(body only), such as Live View function, which enables users to shoot while verifying image framing and focus in real time on the camera’s LCD monitor, and Auto Lighting Optimizer, which detects dark areas of an image and automatically adjusts brightness and contrast to ensure optimal results. The EOS Kiss F also contributes to improved ease of use through its large control buttons and easy-to-see operating panel indications.\n\nThe Canon digital SLR camera incorporates a high-precision 7-point wide-area AF (autofocus) sensor supporting fast and accurate focusing performance, and achieves a continuous shooting speed of approximately 3.0 frames per second with the number of consecutive shots possible in a burst limited only by the capacity of the recording medium.* The EOS Kiss F is compatible with Canon’s extensive lineup of more than 60 EF lenses, including the Image Stabilizer-equipped EF-S18″E5mm f/3.5″E.6 IS, which is included in the camera’s lens kit package.",

      "description": "The mid-range Canon EOS 50D raises image quality and high-speed image processing to next levels with advancements in two key devices: the developed approximately 15.1-million effective pixel CMOS sensor (APS-C size) and the redesigned high-performance DIGIC 4 imaging processor. Along with its enhanced image quality and rich tonal range, the model also utilizes noise-reduction technology to enable high-speed shooting. The EOS 50D supports ISO sensitivity settings from 100 to 3200,*1 which can be expanded to ISO 6400 and 12800 in wide-angle settings, making it the ideal digital SLR camera for a wide range of photographic horizons. Further, because the model accommodates the new CFA 4.1 UDMA CF memory card format for high-speed data transfer, it makes possible a maximum shooting speed of 6.3 frames per second*2 for up to 90*3 consecutive high-resolution images in a burst.\n\nThe EOS 50D’s large 3.0-inch clear view LCD monitor features a 160-degree viewing angle, 920,000 dots, and an anti-reflection coating to shield its protective cover from dust. It provides excellent color reproduction that naturally displays images on the finder and greatly improves daylight visibility outdoors. And further contributing to enhanced user friendliness, the Live View function features improved AF (autofocus) performance through the utilization of Face Detection technology. The EOS 50D delivers outstanding basic performance through such features as high-precision all cross type 9-point AF and a high-performance viewfinder employing a glass pentaprism that provides an approximately 0.95x zoom ratio. Other features embody the evolution of digital SLR technology, such as the Auto Lighting Optimizer, which automatically adjusts the brightness and contrast levels of dark images and can now be used with RAW images.\n\nThe EOS 50D allows users to smoothly set shooting functions while looking at the LCD monitor with the Quick Settings Screen, or use the Creative Full Auto Mode to take the type of photos they want without prior knowledge of such technical terms as “aperture” and “exposure.” Users are also guaranteed a high degree of reliability with the EOS 50D, given its EOS Integrated Cleaning System sensor dust solution, fluoride-coated Self Cleaning Sensor Unit to suppress dust adherence, high-rigidity magnesium alloy exterior, and durable shutter unit capable of withstanding approximately 100,000 cycles. The EOS 50D is compatible with Canon’s comprehensive range of 60-plus EF interchangeable lenses, including the concurrently announced Image Stabilizer-equipped EF-S18-200mm f/3.5-5.6 lens, featuring an 11x zoom for wide-angle to telephoto coverage.",

      "description": "The Canon EOS 5D Mark II succeeds the EOS 5D, launched in October 2005, which marked the first digital SLR camera for advanced-amateur users to incorporate a 35 mm full-frame CMOS sensor and enjoyed lasting market acclaim. The EOS 5D Mark II features a newly developed full-size 21.1-megapixel CMOS sensor that not only realizes outstanding resolution performance and rich gradation expression, but also offers an expanded standard ISO sensitivity range of ISO 100-6400*1 which, in extended mode, can be expanded to ISO 50, 12800 and 25600, enabling optimal performance in a diverse range of shooting situations.\n\nThe EOS 5D Mark II incorporates the next-generation DIGIC 4 image processor, which enables the high-speed processing of the increased amount of data generated by the high-pixel-count image sensor. The technology supports high resolution imaging performance while making possible a continuous shooting speed of up to approximately 3.9 frames per second*2 and bursts of up to approximately 310 shots.*3\n\nOther features facilitating optimal shooting performance include a newly designed high-performance viewfinder that realizes approximately 98% coverage, and a high-speed, high-precision AF (AutoFocus) system with 9 AF points + 6 Assist AF points.\n\nMaking possible the recording of full HD (1,920 x 1,080 pixels) video at 30 frames per second (fps), the EOS 5D Mark II is the first model in the EOS series to offer a movie function, which also includes a standard recording mode (640 x 480/30 fps). Also, further expanding the boundaries of digital SLR photographic expression, the camera incorporates a Live View function with three AF modes — Quick Mode, Live Mode, and Face Detect Live Mode — and a lens peripheral illumination correction function that compensates for light falloff around the image perimeter in response to the characteristics of the type of lens used when shooting.\n\nThe EOS 5D Mark II is equipped with a 920,000-dot, 3.0-inch Clear View LCD monitor with a multi-coating that reduces reflections and resists smudging and smearing. With enhanced color reproduction performance, the LCD monitor delivers natural image display, supporting improved image verification, even in bright sunlight.\n\nCanon’s EOS Integrated Cleaning System, a comprehensive dust-reduction system, combines measures for preventing and eliminating dust. On the EOS 5D Mark II, the technology features an improved Self Cleaning Sensor Unit that includes a fluorine coating on the surface of the low pass filter, which realizes further protection by minimizing dust adhesion.\n\nThe EOS 5D Mark II backs up high performance with strength and durability. The camera’s rugged shutter unit boasts an impressive 150,000-cycle shutter life while the body features a highly rigid magnesium alloy exterior that ensures reliable performance in the face of challenging shooting conditions. Additionally, the EOS 5D Mark II’s new Battery Pack LP-E6 realizes 1.3x the battery capacity of its predecessor, providing users with higher levels of mobility.\n\nIn addition to the EOS 5D Mark II, Canon today also announced the introduction of the Wireless File Transmitter WFT-E4/E4A, which enables the transfer of images to a server or computer via wireless LAN or Ethernet.",

      "description": "The Canon EOS 7D is a cutting-edge digital SLR camera based on the concepts of “uncompromising technical specifications” and “genuine essence appealing to users' senses of sight, sound, and touch.”\n\nThrough the incorporation of a newly developed approximately 18.0-megapixel CMOS sensor (APS-C size) and the inclusion of two high-performance DIGIC 4 image processors in the Dual DIGIC 4 system, the EOS 7D is capable of capturing images with a high degree of resolution and rich gradation expression while also realizing a maximum shooting speed of approximately 8.0*1 frames per second and bursts of up to 94*2 shots. Users can capture beautiful images with minimal noise through an adjustable ISO sensitivity*3 range of ISO 100–6400, which, in extended mode, can be expanded to ISO 12800 for exemplary performance in dark environments.\nCanon's EOS 7D boasts several sophisticated basic features, including a high-performance optical viewfinder with approximate 100% field coverage, 29.4-degree field of view, and 1.0x magnification for precise image composition and focus; 19-point cross-type AutoFocus sensors with a high-precision, centrally positioned Dual Cross sensor; and the iFCL (intelligent Focus Color Luminas), which utilizes AutoFocus and color information for stable image exposure.\n\nThe EOS 7D also features an “EOS Movie” function that supports video recording in a wide range of formats, including full HD (1,920 x 1,080 pixels at speeds of 30/25/24 frames per second). EOS Movie also enables users to record video using manual exposure, which facilities the setting of aperture, shutter speed, and ISO speed. Other cutting-edge technologies incorporated in the EOS 7D include a newly developed shutter that boasts an approximate 150,000-cycle durability, a Dual Axis Electronic Level that detects both horizontal roll and vertical pitch, and a 3.0-inch Clear View LCD II monitor outfitted with reinforced glass. The model sports an ultra-fluid design with a continuously evolving surface curvature for a flowing texture that provides an air of sophistication befitting a cutting-edge digital SLR camera.",

The camera also allows an extended ISO range of 50-102,400. Low-sensitivity settings support outstanding results for outdoor portrait-photo shoots under bright lighting conditions or when using large strobe lights in a studio environment, while high-sensitivity settings boost performance when shooting indoor sports action and night games or conducting nighttime photojournalism. The camera makes possible a continuous shooting speed of up to approximately 10 frames per second for up to approximately 121 large JPEG images in a single burst.\n\nThe EOS-1D Mark IV’s newly developed 45-point AF (autofocus) sensor, including 39 cross-type AF points with sensitivity up to f/2.8, ensures greatly improved focusing accuracy. Equipped with AI Servo AF II, incorporating a new algorithm, the camera achieves high levels of AF stability and tracking performance.",

      "description": "The new EOS Kiss X4, successor to the popular EOS Kiss X3, combines a new APS-C size (22.3 x 14.9 mm) 18.0 million effective pixel CMOS sensor with Canon’s proprietary DIGIC 4 imaging processor to deliver both enhanced image performance and reduced noise. The model supports an extended ISO range from 100–6400, which can be expanded to ISO 12800, as well as an Auto ISO feature allowing users to select an ISO maximum setting during image capture for increased functionality.\n\nThe Canon EOS Kiss X4 enables the capture of high-image-quality and low-noise video, offering a selection of different recording sizes, frame rates and interchangeable lens combinations to realize rich movie capture across a range of shooting conditions. The camera records Full HD (1,920 x 1,080 pixels) movies at frame rates of 30, 25 and 24 frames per second (fps); HD (1,280 x 720 pixels) movies at frame rates of 60 and 50 fps; and standard definition (640 x 480 pixels) movies at frame rates of 60 and 50 fps. In addition, the EOS Kiss X4 facilitates manual control of exposure settings during video capture, allowing users to adjust the aperture, shutter speed and ISO sensitivity settings as well as offering a movie crop function that makes possible recording within a central 640 x 480 pixel area of the sensor at an equivalent of approximately 7x magnification.\n\nThe Canon EOS Kiss X4 features an enhanced Live View mode allowing users to easily frame and shoot subjects from the LCD monitor, which features approximately 100% viewing-field coverage. The Live View mode supports a variety of functions, including automatic and portrait modes, and an Auto Lighting Optimizer that delivers natural, balanced results in conditions prone to underexposure and low contrast. Additionally, Live View offers three AF (autofocus) modes: a Live Mode utilizing contrast-detection technology, Face Detection Mode utilizing contrast AF to recognize human faces, and Quick Mode which swiftly selects a focus point in the Live View image display.\n\nThe new Canon EOS Kiss X4 incorporates an enhanced 3.0-inch 1.04-million dot Clear View LCD monitor that displays full-screen images at a 3:2 aspect ratio and features a multi-layer coating that reduces reflections and protects against scratches and dirt. The Quick Control screen, easily accessible by pressing the Quick Control button, opens on the LCD monitor, allowing users to effortlessly change camera settings such as shutter speed, aperture, ISO setting, and exposure from a single screen.\n\nThe Canon EOS Kiss X4 features high-speed continuous shooting of up to approximately 3.7 frames per second for up to 34 large/fine JPEG images at a time when using a 4GB SDHC card*1, high-precision 9-point AF, and expanded exposure correction +/-5 steps. In addition, the model incorporates iFCL Metering with a 63-zone dual-layer metering system utilizing both auto focus*2 and color information to provide accurate exposure even in difficult lighting conditions.",

The camera supports an extended ISO range* of 100-6400, which can be expanded to ISO 12800. Additionally, the model enables high-quality image capture through such enhancements in basic features as a 9-point all cross-type AF (autofocus) sensor, which enables high-precision auto focus performance, and Canon’s 63-zone Dual-layer Metering Sensor, which delivers accurate exposure control.\n\nThe first model in the EOS series to incorporate a 3.0-inch 1.04-million dot Vari-Angle Clear View LCD monitor with a 3:2 aspect ratio, the new Canon EOS 60D allows users to easily view the monitor while shooting at high or low angles, all while maintaining a compact body that is smaller than its predecessor, the EOS 50D, launched in September 2008. Further contributing to enhanced operability, the previously separate Multi-Controller and Quick Control Dial have now been combined to form a Multi-Control Dial, while the Quick Setting Button, which opens on the LCD monitor when pressed, enables users to effortlessly change such camera settings as shutter speed, aperture, ISO setting, and exposure from a single screen.\n\nThe EOS 60D’s Basic + Function feature enables the adjustment of an image’s “atmosphere” by allowing users to apply such settings as “light and soft” or “sharp and vivid.” In addition, the newly incorporated Creative Filter function enables the processing of photos using one of four filter options, including Miniature Effect and Soft Focus.\nThe Canon EOS 60D also enables the capture of high-quality, low-noise video, offering a selection of different recording sizes, frame rates and interchangeable lens combinations to realize rich movie capture across a range of shooting conditions.",

      "description": "The new Canon EOS Kiss X5 incorporates a Scene Intelligent Auto feature, which newly brings together five automatic functions-AE (Auto Exposure), AF (Auto Focus), AWB (Auto White Balance), ALO (Auto Lighting Optimizer), and the new Picture Style Auto. Using Canon’s Scene Detection Technology, Scene Intelligent Auto automatically analyzes such information as faces, color, brightness, movement, contrast and distance, and applies the optimal settings to deliver effortless shooting in various situations, including nature and outdoor settings, portraits, and evening conditions.\nThe new X5, the first EOS Kiss model to include a 3.0-inch 1.04-million dot Vari-Angle Clear View LCD monitor with a 3:2 aspect ratio, enables users to easily view the monitor while shooting at high or low angles. Building on the popularity of the EOS Movie feature offered in the previous model, the new Kiss camera offers further improvements in Full HD video recording capabilities. Allowing users to not only enjoy video capture, but also the viewing and sharing of movies, the X5 is the first in the EOS series to offer a Video Snapshot mode enabling the capture of movie clips 2, 4 or 8 seconds in length, which can be synced with background music during playback. Furthermore, a movie crop function, also a popular feature offered in the previous model, has been improved to deliver recording within a central area of the sensor at an equivalent of approximately 3x to 10x magnification.\nThe Canon Kiss X5 is equipped with an approximately 18.0-million effective pixel APS-C size (approx. 22.3 x 14.9 mm) CMOS sensor and Canon’s proprietary high-performance DIGIC 4 image processor to deliver high image quality with reduced noise. Additionally, the new camera offers a range of expression-enhancing features, including Basic + Function, which enables the adjustment of an image’s “atmosphere” by allowing users to apply such settings as “light and soft” or “sharp and vivid.”",

      "description": "Featuring a newly developed 35 mm full-frame approximately 22.3-megapixel CMOS sensor and the DIGIC 5+ image processor, the Canon EOS 5D Mark III offers enhanced AF (autofocus) precision and a faster maximum continuous shooting speed while realizing outstanding image quality for both still photography and video capture.\n\nSucceeding the highly acclaimed EOS 5D Mark II, released in November 2008, the Canon EOS 5D Mark III digital SLR camera achieves significant advances in imaging performance to support a wide range of imaging-expression possibilities. The newly developed 35 mm full-frame approximately 22.3-megapixel CMOS sensor employs an improved photo diode structure and eliminates the gaps between the microlenses to realize enhanced sensitivity and low-noise performance. Incorporating a DIGIC 5+ image processor, which achieves approximately 17 times the processing power of the DIGIC 4, the 5D Mark III delivers both high image quality and high-speed performance. In addition, DIGIC 5+ works together with the newly developed CMOS sensor to make possible high-resolution imaging with a wide dynamic range.\n\nCompared with its predecessor’s ISO100-6400 sensitivity range, the EOS 5D Mark III features an ISO range that has been expanded by two steps to ISO100-25600,* delivering impressive imaging results with reduced noise even in low-light settings.\n\nSimilar to the top-of-the-line EOS-1D X, the EOS 5D Mark III’s newly developed AF System incorporates a new 61-Point High Density Reticular AF, including 41 cross-type AF points, to support a range of shooting compositions and deliver greater accuracy when tracking moving subjects. In particular, the AF System excels when shooting portraits and moving subjects.\n\nThe EOS 5D Mark III’s newly developed CMOS sensor features 8-channel readout, an improvement over the 4-channel readout speed offered by its predecessor. By combining the CMOS sensor with the high-speed processing performance of DIGIC 5+, the camera achieves high-speed continuous shooting of up to approximately 6 fps while maintaining a high pixel count of approximately 22.3 megapixels.",

      "description": "To date, Canon has developed its top-of-the-line digital SLR cameras through the 1Ds series, which delivers exceptionally high image quality, and the 1D series, which achieves superlative high-speed performance. Integrating the strengths of these two series, Canon’s new professional flagship model, the EOS-1D X, brings together the highest levels of image quality and speed performance.\n\nThe Canon EOS-1D X incorporates a newly developed approximately 18.1-megapixel 35 mm full-frame CMOS sensor which, in addition to achieving an optimal sensor size and pixel count balance, effectively makes use of Canon’s proprietary semiconductor technologies to ensure low-noise performance. Featuring Dual DIGIC 5+, which comprises two new high-performance DIGIC 5+ image processors—each realizing approximately 17 times the processing power of DIGIC 4— the camera delivers exemplary image quality and speed performance. Compared with the EOS-1D Mark IV’s sensitivity range of ISO100-12800, the EOS-1D X offers a range that has been expanded by two steps, to 100-51200,* for outstanding imaging results with reduced noise, even when shooting indoors and other dimly lit settings.\n\nCombining a 100,000-pixel RGB metering sensor and DIGIC 4 processor, the Canon EOS-1D X’s new AE system, the EOS iSA (Intelligent Subject Analysis) System, is capable of determining not only brightness levels, but also a subject’s face and target color, making possible high-precision exposure control. The newly developed AF system incorporates an AF sensor with a total of 61 autofocus points for improved high-precision subject capture. The sensor includes 21 f/5.6 cross-type sensors, 20 f/4.0 cross-type sensors, and 5 f/2.8 dual cross-type sensors. Equipped with 20 f/4.0 AF points, the new camera offers the same level of precision as the EOS-1D Mark IV at f/2.8. Additionally, working in tandem with the new AE system, the camera’s EOS iTR AF (Intelligent Tracking and Recognition Auto Focus) function is capable of tracking a subject’s face or target color to maintain focus on a moving subject.\n\nThe Canon EOS-1D X’s new Dual DIGIC 5+ image processors make possible high-speed continuous shooting of up to approximately 12 frames per second with high-precision AE and AF performance. In the ultra-fast continuous shooting mode, the camera realizes a continuous shooting speed of up to approximately 14 frames per second (mirror remains raised during shooting, JPEG images only).",

      "description": "EOS 60Da is a digital single-lens reflex (SLR) camera designed for use in astrophotography.*1 Ideal for advanced-amateur enthusiasts who enjoy capturing the night sky, the new specialized camera features optical characteristics tailored for astrophotography, enabling red nebulae and other astronomical phenomena to be photographed in high resolution.\n\nBased on Canon’s EOS 60D digital SLR camera, released in September 2010, the new EOS 60Da’s modified infrared (IR) blocking filter, positioned in front of the CMOS sensor, features characteristics that increase the transmission of light at the Hydrogen Alpha (H-a) line wavelength,*2 by a factor of 3x compared with the 60D. This modification enables enthusiasts to capture high-resolution images of such astronomical phenomena as the Rosette Nebula and Horsehead Nebula, both popular for their reddish color, without having to employ a special filter.a challenging feat for conventional digital cameras.\n\nMaking full use of the EOS 60D’s exceptional basic features, the new EOS 60Da incorporates an approximately 18.0-megapixel CMOS sensor and a high-performance DIGIC 4 image processor, a combination that makes possible an extended normal sensitivity range of up to ISO6400. The camera delivers high-quality, high-resolution images with reduced noise, an important factor when considering the distinctive darkness and long exposure times required in astrophotography.",

      "description": "The Canon EOS Kiss X6i, successor to the EOS Kiss X5 (released in March of 2011), employs a nine-point, all cross type, AF sensor—a first for the EOS Kiss series—that, during viewfinder shooting, achieves excellent focusing results regardless of the image composition or subject pattern. Furthermore, the f/2.8 cross-type central point delivers even higher focus precision when shooting with a lens with a maximum aperture of f/2.8 or faster. During Live View shooting and movie recording, the camera delivers faster focusing performance compared with the previous model thanks to the newly developed Hybrid CMOS AF which, in addition to contrast-detection AF, includes phase-detection AF made possible through the CMOS sensor. When shooting with Live View, newly incorporated Continuous AF continually focuses on a subject for high-speed results, and when recording video, new Movie Servo AF tracks subjects for smooth focusing performance, even when shooting moving subjects. Furthermore, the X6i achieves especially quiet, smooth AF operation when coupled with the new EF-S18-135mm f/3.5-5.6 IS STM interchangeable lens (to be released in late June 2012), enabling users to effortlessly enjoy capturing EOS Movies.\n\nEquipped with a newly developed approximately 18.0-megapixel APS-C size CMOS sensor and the new DIGIC 5 image processor, which delivers approximately six times the processing power of the DIGIC 4, the Canon EOS Kiss X6i offers not only high image quality, but also high-speed continuous shooting of up to approximately 5 frames per second. Thanks to the incorporation of the newly developed CMOS sensor and DIGIC 5, the camera’s maximum standard ISO sensitivity has been expanded to ISO12800,* which can be extended to ISO25600, making possible high-quality images with reduced noise and image blur, even in dimly lit settings. Because high-sensitivity settings allow faster shutter speeds, users can curb hand-shake and subject blur during handheld shooting or when capturing moving subjects.\n\nThe EOS Kiss X6i’s 3.0-inch Vari-Angle Clear View LCD monitor, in addition to offering a wide range of movement to support shooting from a variety of angles, employs an electrostatic touch panel to allow users to select shooting settings and AF point with a simple touch of a finger, as well as magnify or reduce images during playback. The Handheld Night Scene Mode, newly included on the camera’s mode dial, enables the shooting of night scenes without a tripod by capturing four images in rapid succession using a fast shutter speed, which are then combined to produce beautiful results with minimal blur. The mode dial also newly incorporates an HDR (High Dynamic Range) Backlight Control Mode setting, which captures three images in rapid succession—one underexposed, one with normal exposure and one overexposed—and overlays them to create a natural-looking image with minimal loss of detail in bright or dark areas of a picture, even in backlit shooting conditions.",

      "description": "Inheriting the EOS series’s basic concepts of high speed, ease of use and high image quality, the EOS M delivers high-image-quality performance on par with the EOS lineup and, employing a non-reflex operating system, achieves a lightweight, compact body design. In addition, in response to entry-level users who wish to capture even higher quality pictures with more ease, the camera features an interchangeable-lens system that supports the use of not only new dedicated EF-M lenses, but also Canon’s extensive lineup of EF lenses.*1\n\nBoasting a level of image quality that has come to represent the Canon EOS series, the EOS M incorporates an approximately 18.0-megapixel APS-C size CMOS sensor and DIGIC 5 image processor comparable to those used in EOS digital single-lens reflex (SLR) cameras. Canon’s proprietary CMOS sensor and the DIGIC 5 image processor make possible a maximum standard ISO sensitivity that has been expanded to ISO12800,*2 which can be extended to ISO25600, enabling high-quality image capture with reduced noise even in low-light environments. Furthermore, because high-sensitivity settings allow faster shutter speeds, users can curb hand-shake and subject blur during handheld shooting or when capturing moving subjects. The camera’s sensor employs Hybrid AF, which makes use of both phase and contrast AF to deliver smooth focusing performance that is fast and accurate. When capturing video, the Movie Servo AF function realizes continuous smooth focusing, even when shooting moving subjects.\n\nEmploying a non-reflex system and a newly developed lens mount, the Canon EOS M features a body design that is significantly smaller in size and lighter in weight compared with digital SLR cameras. In addition to offering a high-quality, stylish design, the new interchangeable-lens EOS M employs a shutter button with the same operational feel as the EOS series as well as a grip designed to provide optimal holding performance. Supporting a wide range of user preferences, the camera comes available in four body color variations: black, silver, red and white.*3",

      "description": "Developed for users wishing to effortlessly enjoy the high image quality afforded by a 35 mm full-frame camera, the Canon EOS 6D features a lightweight, compact body design, making it ideally suited as the next-step model for entry-level SLR camera users or as a secondary camera for advanced-amateur enthusiasts.\n\nIncorporating a newly developed approximately 20.2-megapixel 35 mm full-frame CMOS sensor, the Canon EOS 6D delivers the impressive background image blur unique to full-frame cameras while also realizing a maximum continuous shooting speed of approximately 4.5 images per second. By combining the newly developed CMOS image sensor with the high-performance DIGIC 5+ image processor, the camera realizes a wide dynamic range with exceptional color reproduction and rich gradation. Furthermore, the 6D offers a maximum ISO setting that has been expanded to 25600,*1 which can be extended to 102400, making possible high-quality image results with reduced noise even in low-light environments.\n\nFeaturing a body that weighs approximately 680 g, making it the world’s lightest*2 35 mm full-frame digital SLR camera, the EOS 6D enables effortless handheld shooting and contributes to the expansion of imaging possibilities. By reducing the size of the shutter unit, mirror motor drive and CMOS sensor package, the model is the same approximate size and weight as the EOS 60D (released in September 2010), which employs an APS-C sensor.\n\nThe Canon EOS 6D’s built-in wireless LAN function*3 allows the capture, playback and sharing of still images and video to be performed wirelessly. Still image and video data can be sent to devices that support a Wi-Fi connection, such as smartphones, PCs and Canon-brand cameras*4 and printers,*5 as well as DLNA-compatible televisions*6 and the online photo service Canon iMAGE GATEWAY*7. The EOS Remote*8 application for smartphones supporting Wi-Fi enables the 6D to be operated remotely, allowing users to confirm the camera’s Live View display and capture still images from a smartphone. Furthermore, still images (JPEG) saved in the camera’s memory card can be transferred to a smartphone.",

      "description": "The Canon EOS Kiss X7i, successor to the EOS Kiss X6i (released in June 2012), incorporates an APS-C-size approximately 18.0-megapixel CMOS sensor and the high-speed DIGIC 5 image processor to deliver both high image quality and high-speed continuous shooting up to approximately five frames per second. The camera features standard ISO sensitivity of up to 12800,* which can be extended to ISO 25600, making possible exceptional images with reduced noise even in dimly lit environments. Furthermore, the Kiss X7i’s high-sensitivity performance allows faster shutter speeds for reduced hand-shake and subject blur not only when capturing photos in low-light conditions, but also during handheld shooting, when recording moving subjects, and when capturing photos in locations where flash photography is not allowed.\n\nDuring video recording, the EOS Kiss X7i’s Movie Servo AF function tracks moving subjects for smooth focusing performance. In addition, when paired with the EF-S18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 IS STM interchangeable lens (released in April of 2013), equipped with a stepping motor, the camera achieves especially quiet, smooth AF operation.\nThe Canon EOS Kiss X7i employs a 9-point, all cross-type AF system that, during viewfinder shooting, makes possible excellent focusing results regardless of the image composition or subject pattern.\n\nOffering a selection of seven Creative Filters, the EOS Kiss X7i newly allows users to preview the effects of each filter on the Live View screen before snapping a photo, enabling users to select the best filter for expressing their creative intent. The Special Scene (SCN) setting combines three shooting modes—Night Portrait, High Dynamic Range (HDR) Backlight Control and Handheld Night Scene—allowing users to easily capture high-quality images even under challenging shooting conditions. The SCN setting is easily accessible from the new mode dial, which rotates 360 degrees to support faster setting selection. In addition to inheriting the gracefully curved, compact body design of its predecessor, the Kiss X7i newly features a high-quality exterior coating for an enhanced look and feel.",

Despite its compact, lightweight body, made possible through the downsizing of such components as the shutter unit and CMOS package, the diminutive camera’s APS-C-size approximately 18.0-megapixel CMOS sensor and DIGIC 5 image processor combine for exceptional image quality and a high-speed continuous shooting speed of approximately 4 frames per second. Additionally, offering a maximum standard ISO of 12800*2 (expandable to ISO 25600), the X7 enables the capture of images with reduced noise and image blur, even in low-light conditions and when shooting a moving subject.\n\nWhen capturing images in Live View mode or shooting movies, the Kiss X7’s newly developed Hybrid CMOS AF II combines high-precision contrast AF and high-speed phase-detection AF, the latter made possible by the camera’s CMOS sensor, to enable high-performance AF across approximately 80% vertically and horizontally of the image-display area. By offering a larger focus area than the earlier model, users can realize improved focusing performance and compose shots with greater flexibility.\n\nThe EOS Kiss X7 includes three all-new family-oriented scene modes—Kids, Food and Candlelight—which, added to the previous HDR Backlight Control, Night Portrait and Handheld Night Scene, bring the total number of special-scene shooting modes to six. The Kids mode lets users capture blur-free images of even the most active of children while ensuring healthy skin tones. The Food mode makes possible bright, vivid, visually savory images. And the Candlelight mode enables the capture of images that preserve the ambiance of scenes illuminated by candlelight alone, such as the candles on a birthday cake.",

      "description": "The Canon EOS 70D was developed for users looking to step up from entry-level models and advanced amateurs seeking to extend their photographic horizons. In addition to key devices upgraded from the preceding EOS 60D (released in September 2010), including the CMOS sensor and image processor, the 70D incorporates Dual Pixel CMOS AF, a new autofocus technology that provides significantly improved AF performance during Live View shooting and when shooting movies. Responding to a diverse range of user needs in accordance with varied shooting styles, the new camera contributes to expanding the realm of photographic possibilities.\n\nWhen using the Live View function, new Dual Pixel CMOS AF enables sharp focus to be obtained through phase-difference AF*1 until final focus is achieved—the same as when shooting through the viewfinder—across approximately 80% vertically and horizontally of the shooting area. Compared with Canon’s previous image-plane phase-difference AF, Dual Pixel CMOS AF realizes shorter focusing times and exceptional tracking performance. Additionally, when shooting movies, the improved tracking capabilities of the Movie Servo AF ensure continuously smooth focusing performance, even when filming quickly moving subjects.\n\nEquipped with a newly developed APS-C-size approximately 20.2-megapixel CMOS sensor and the DIGIC 5+ image processor, which makes possible high-speed image processing, the EOS 70D delivers exceptional image quality and a fast continuous shooting speed of up to approximately 7 frames per second. Additionally, offering a maximum standard ISO of 12800*2 (expandable to ISO 25600), the camera enables the capture of images with reduced noise, even when shooting in low-light conditions.When shooting through the viewfinder, the camera’s 19-point all cross-type AF system provides support for a variety of image compositions and realizes outstanding focusing performance for moving subjects.\n\nFeaturing built-in Wi-Fi, the EOS 70D allows users to use their smartphone as a wireless controller to shoot stills with the camera from afar.*3 Additionally, still images (JPEG) stored on the camera’s memory card can be transferred and saved to a compatible smartphone, PC or other device.",

      "description": "The EOS Kiss X70 was developed to meet the needs of entry-level users who want to take better pictures with greater ease. Compared with the previously released EOS Kiss X50 (released in March 2011), the X70 realizes significantly enhanced basic performance.\n\nEquipped with an approximately 18-megapixel APS-C-size CMOS sensor and Canon’s high-performance DIGIC 4 image processor, the EOS Kiss X70 delivers exceptional imaging performance and a fast maximum continuous shooting speed of approximately three frames per second. Additionally, offering a maximum standard ISO of 6400 (expandable to ISO equivalent to 12800), the camera enables the capture of images with reduced noise and image blur, even in low-light conditions and when shooting a moving subject.Because the EOS Kiss X70 enables the shooting of Full HD video, users can create film-like high-quality movies that benefit from the impressive blur-characteristics unique to SLR cameras.\n\nThe camera features a Scene Intelligent Auto mode that analyzes the image, accounting for faces, colors, brightness, moving objects, contrast, and even whether the camera is being handheld or on a tripod, and then chooses the exposure and enhancements that bring out the best in any scene or situation. Because the Scene Intelligent Auto mode simplifies DSLR image capture, photographers are free to concentrate on composing their shots. The X70 also offers five different creative filters for still images—Grainy B/W, Fisheye Effect, Soft Focus, Toy Camera Effect and Miniature Effect—letting users easily apply appealing effects to their photos.\n\nDespite its enhanced feature set, the EOS Kiss X70 maintains the same body dimensions as its predecessor while realizing a lighter body weight. Additionally, like high-end SLR cameras, the grip includes rubber sections on the front and back for optimal holding performance.",

      "description": "Canon EOS 7D Mark II, in addition to achieving a fast continuous shooting speed of up to approximately 10 frames per second (fps), features an all-new AF system that covers a wide imaging area and employs 65 autofocus points, each of which provides cross-type coverage*1—the highest number of cross-type autofocus points offered by any EOS-series camera. The camera is equipped with the EOS iTR AF (Intelligent Tracking and Recognition Auto Focus) function, which tracks a subject’s face or target color, and AI Servo AF III, which delivers high-precision autofocus tracking.\nFurthermore, the EOS 7D Mark II newly incorporates the Intelligent Viewfinder II, which displays AF sensor points and information related to various camera settings, enabling users to change shooting settings without having to pull away from the viewfinder.\nEmploying a newly developed approximately 20.2-megapixel APS-C-size CMOS sensor and Canon’s Dual DIGIC 6 image processors, the new 7D Mark II realizes a maximum standard ISO sensitivity of ISO16000*2 when capturing both photos and movies, making possible outstanding imaging results with reduced noise and rich color gradation. Furthermore, the camera’s improved AE (Automatic Exposure) system not only precisely controls exposure based on the subject being tracked, but also detects and compensates for flickering light when shooting in artificial lighting.\nDelivering high reliability even in harsh shooting conditions, the EOS 7D Mark II offers exceptional dust and water resistance, and features a magnesium alloy body design that makes possible superior durability.\nIncorporating Canon’s Dual Pixel CMOS AF technology, which delivers smooth, highly responsive autofocusing performance, the EOS 7D Mark II enables users to effortlessly capture clear, highly expressive movies. The new digital SLR camera is capable of recording Full HD video at a fast frame rate of 59.94 fps, and newly supports MP4, a file format that offers high compatibility with a variety of movie player hardware and software.",

      "description": "The Canon EOS M3, successor to the EOS M2 (released in December 2013), combines an approximately 24.2-megapixel APS-C-size CMOS sensor with the Company's latest image processor, DIGIC 6, to deliver both high-resolution, high-quality imaging performance and a fast continuous shooting speed of up to approximately 4.2 frames per second. Furthermore, with a standard ISO speed ranging from 100 to 12800 (expandable to ISO 25600), the camera supports the capture of images with reduced noise, even when shooting in low-light conditions.\nBased on the scene being captured, the EOS M3’s Hybrid CMOS AF*1 III enables focusing using only phase-difference AF to realize a focusing speed that is up to approximately 3.8 times*2 faster than that of its predecessor. Additionally, the combination of Hybrid CMOS AF III and the camera’s tilt LCD monitor and Touch Shutter feature makes possible quick and easy subject focusing.\nFacilitating effortless manual operation, Canon's EOS M3 includes a variety of functions supporting superior operability on a par with that realized by EOS-series digital SLR cameras. In addition to a front dial offering intuitive operability, the EOS M3 includes a dedicated exposure compensation dial that lets users adjust exposure with a simple turn of a dial. Furthermore, the camera includes a touch-screen LCD monitor that can be tilted upwards and downwards by approximately 180 degrees and 45 degrees, respectively, for greater shooting flexibility.\nEquipped with Wi-Fi and NFC technology, the new EOS M3 allows users to wirelessly capture, playback and share photos and videos.",

      "description": "Featuring the highest resolution among EOS entry-level SLR cameras, the EOS Kiss X8i incorporates an approximately 24.2-megapixel APS-C-size CMOS sensor that, coupled with Canon’s DIGIC 6 image processor, delivers both impressive image quality performance and a fast continuous shooting speed of up to approximately five frames per second. Furthermore, the cameras’ AF system, comprising 19 all cross-type AF points,*1 is on a par with that employed in the high-end EOS 70D (released in August 2013), and realizes a significant increase in AF points over the 9 point all cross-type AF system included in the EOS Kiss X7i (released in April 2013).\n\nThe Canon EOS Kiss X8i features Hybrid CMOS AF*2 III, an AF technology that has been greatly enhanced to ensure high-speed AF performance during Live View shooting and when capturing video. Based on the scene being captured, Hybrid CMOS AF III enables focusing using only phase-difference AF, making possible a focusing speed that is up to approximately 4.8 times*3 faster than that offered by the EOS Kiss X7 (released in April 2013), which employs Hybrid CMOS AF II. Additionally, the combination of Hybrid CMOS AF III and the cameras’ touch-screen vari-angle LCD monitor and Touch Shutter feature, which lets users release shutter simply by touching the LCD screen, enables quick and easy focus on a subject.\n\nFeaturing Wi-Fi and NFC*4 technology, the new EOS-series entry-level lineup allows users to transfer image files or remotely operate the camera using a smartphone or other mobile device.*5 In addition, through a connection made possible by simply bringing the EOS Kiss X8i in contact with the Canon Connect Station CS100, a new-concept photo and movie storage device to be released in June 2015, users can easily back-up and manage their photo and video libraries.",

      "description": "The Canon EOS 5DS and 5DS R, targeting professional and advanced-amateur photographers, feature a Canon-developed 50.6-megapixel 35 mm full-frame CMOS sensor that delivers extraordinary resolution. For users who place greater emphasis on maximizing the sensor’s resolving power over the occurrence of false colors and moiré, the 5DS R has been designed to cancel the effect of the camera’s optical low pass filter.\n\nIn addition to the world’s highest-resolution*1 imaging made possible by the approximately 50.6-megapixel CMOS sensor, the Canon EOS 5DS and 5DS R incorporate Dual DIGIC 6 image processors, facilitating such exceptional basic performance features as high-speed continuous shooting of up to approximately 5.0 frames per second and a maximum standard ISO of 6400 (expandable to ISO 12800).\n\nMaximizing the benefits of the high-resolution image sensor, the EOS 5DS and 5DS R employ a cam-driven mirror vibration control system that reduces camera-shake blur, a problem that becomes particularly prevalent as pixel counts increase. The models also offer a range of features befitting their impressive imaging capabilities, including a new Picture Style mode—Fine Detail mode—that prioritizes the depiction of subtle image details, and Crop Shooting, which capitalizes on the cameras’ ultra-high pixel count to create a pseudo telephoto effect, enabling crop shooting of approximately 1.3x (approximately 30.5 megapixels) and approximately 1.6x (approximately 19.6 megapixels).\n\nThe 5DS and 5DS R are the first EOS-series cameras to offer a Time Lapse Movie function that lets users combine a series of still images captured at designated intervals over a given period of time to create movie clips of up to two minutes*2 in length. Marking another EOS first, the new cameras include a Custom Quick Control function that realizes enhanced usability by enabling users to tailor the Quick Control screen in accordance with individual user preferences and shooting styles. The function lets users create their own Quick Control screen for easy access to frequently used settings.",

      "description": "Successor to the EOS 70D (released in August 2013), the EOS 80D is equipped with a newly developed APS-C-size approximately 24.2-megapixel CMOS sensor and the DIGIC 6 image processor, enabling a maximum standard ISO of 16000 (ISO 12800 when shooting movies) while delivering high image quality capable of expressing the subtle textures and three dimensionality of subjects. The camera supports full-fledged viewfinder shooting through such features as an optical viewfinder offering approximately 100% coverage*1 for enhanced image-composition ease, and 45-point all cross-type AF*2 for improved autofocusing accuracy. Additionally, further capitalizing on the benefits offered by SLR cameras, the 80D realizes a fast continuous shooting speed of up to approximately seven frames per second.\n\nDual Pixel CMOS AF, an autofocus technology in which each effective pixel on the CMOS sensor is able to perform both phase-difference autofocusing and imaging functions, provides smooth AF performance with exceptional subject-tracking capabilities during movie shooting. Contributing to expanded movie-shooting freedom, the EOS 80D also lets users take advantage of Dual Pixel CMOS AF when recording Full HD 60p movies.\n\nSupporting Wi-Fi and NFC (Near Field Communication)*3 connectivity, the EOS 80D not only enables the transfer of still images and movies to and from compatible cameras, but also supports remote shooting and file transfer via a smartphone, tablet or other mobile device*4.",

      "description": "Compared with its predecessor, the EOS-1D X (released in June 2012), the EOS-1D X Mark II features improved image quality and a faster continuous shooting speed, as well as enhanced movie-shooting and connectivity capabilities.\n\nIts fundamental performance greatly improves on its predecessor through such key device upgrades as a Canon-developed approximately 20.2-megapixel 35mm full-frame CMOS sensor, new high-performance Dual DIGIC 6+ image processors, a new AF sensor, and a newly developed approximately 360,000 pixel RGB+IR metering sensor. Thanks to these improvements, the EOS-1D X Mark II can perform high-speed continuous shooting of approximately 14 frames per second (fps) with high-precision AF and AE performance while maintaining high-resolution imaging performance.\n\nWith improved minimum-illumination AF performance, the EOS 1D X Mark II raises the bar on what can be achieved when shooting in low-light environments. In addition, the camera’s Anti-Flicker Shooting function is capable of detecting and compensating for flickering light sources, ensuring optimal exposure by only shooting at peak light volume.\n\nThanks to Dual Pixel CMOS AF, in which all of the CMOS sensor’s pixels include both imaging and the phase-difference detection AF functions, the EOS-1D X Mark II is capable of high-speed AF tracking.\n\nIn addition to smooth 4K/60p high definition video shooting capabilities, the EOS-1D X Mark II is capable of shooting high-frame-rate video (in full HD) at 120 fps for slow motion capture. The 4K Frame Capture function* enables users to extract selected frames from recorded 4K video as approximately 8.8-megapixel JPEG still images.\n\nCanon’s EOS-1D X Mark II is equipped with communication features to meet professional needs, such as connectivity with USB 3.0 and Gigabit-Ethernet, enabling the transmission of data across a network at high speeds. In addition, incorporating a built-in GPS unit, it can record location information and time stamp information, making file management more efficient for professionals dealing with large quantities of data.",

      "description": "Featuring an approximately 30.4 million effective pixel 35 mm full-frame CMOS sensor and DIGIC 6+ imaging processor, the EOS 5D Mark IV achieves a standard ISO sensitivity range of 100-32000. Additionally, equipped with a newly developed mirror vibration control system, the camera achieves a maximum continuous-shooting speed of approximately 7 frames per second (fps). What’s more, it makes possible Dual Pixel RAW (DPRAW) shooting, which affixes the dual-pixel information captured by the image sensor to RAW images that can be used by Canon’s proprietary (free-of-charge) RAW processing software, Digital Photo Professional (Ver. 4.5), to perform such minute image processing as image micro-adjustment, bokeh shift and ghosting reduction.\n\nThe Canon EOS 5D Mark IV is equipped with 61 point high-density reticular AF II, achieving an expanded longitudinal focus area compared with its predecessor, and makes possible autofocus for all AF points*1 up to an aperture of f/8 when using an extender for super-telephoto shooting. Additionally, the AF can focus with high precision even in low-light environments with a minimum illumination of EV-3 at the central AF point. What’s more, the Digital Lens Optimizer function enables the correction of image degradation caused by lens distortion and diffraction phenomena, corrections that couldn’t be performed by conventional lens optics alone, and compensates for the apparent deterioration of high resolution caused by a low-pass filter.\nAlso, featuring the same approximately 150,000 pixel RGB+IR metering sensor as the EOS 5DS/5DS R (released in June 2015), the Eos 5D Mark IV achieves enhanced subject detection and tracking performance.\n\nThe EOS 5D Mark IV makes possible high-definition 4K video shooting at 30p, Full HD video at 60p, and 120p HD video ideal for slow motion, and offers a time lapse function that combines still images taken at a fixed interval to create a time-lapse video. Additionally, equipped with the same 4K frame capture function featured on the flagship EOS-1D X Mark II, users can extract selected frames*2 from recorded 4K video as approximately 8.8 megapixel JPEG still images.",

      "description": "Equipped with CMOS sensors with pixels capable of both phase detection AF and image capture, the EOS 9000D is the first entry-class models to feature Dual Pixel CMOS AF and achieve the world’s fastest*1 high-speed AF when shooting in live view. Additionally, when shooting with the viewfinder, these cameras offer the same 45-point all cross-type AF*2 as the high-end model EOS 80D, making possible expansive, highly accurate focusing.\n\nEquipped with the newest DIGIC 7 image processor and an approximately 24.2 million effective pixel*3 APS-C size CMOS sensor, these cameras achieve a normal high sensitivity of ISO25600 when shooting still images and a sensitivity of ISO12800 when shooting video. Additionally, these cameras realize up to approximately 6 frames per second (fps) continuous shooting.\n\nBy directly connecting to such devices as printers, computers and smartphones using Wi-Fi, NFC and Bluetooth® low energy technology*4, these cameras make possible remote shooting and easy wireless transfer of stills and videos to these devices to save or share on social media.",

      "description": "* Not available in some parts of China\n\nThe EOS Ra, a full-frame mirrorless camera designed for use in astrophotography1. Ideal for enthusiast photographers who enjoy capturing the night sky, the new specialized camera features a full-frame CMOS sensor with up to approximately 30.3 million effective pixels2 and optical characteristics tailored for astrophotography, enabling red nebulae and other astronomical phenomena to be vividly photographed in high resolution.\n\nBased on Canon’s EOS R mirrorless interchangeable-lens camera, released in October 2018, the EOS Ra’s modified infrared (IR) blocking filter, positioned in front of the CMOS sensor, features characteristics that increase the transmission of light at the Hydrogen Alpha line wavelength, or H-α wavelength3, by a factor of approximately 4x compared with the EOS R. In addition, the camera’s CMOS sensor and DIGIC 8 image processor make possible low-noise shooting and a maximum normal high sensitivity of ISO40000. Thanks to these capabilities, users can capture vivid, high-resolution photographs of such subjects with strong red tinges as the Lagoon Nebula (M8), the Trifid Nebula (M20) and the Carina Nebula.\n\nThe compact and lightweight EOS Ra is equipped with a vari-angle LCD monitor that enables use of live-view and adjustment of image-capture settings, even when the camera is attached to a tripod. What’s more, magnification in live-mode viewing can be increased from the maximum 10x of the EOS R to a maximum of 30x. This increased magnification allows small stars to appear larger on the LCD screen, enabling more precise focus selection when photographing astral bodies.",

In addition, the EOS R50 achieves continuous shooting of up to approximately 15 fps with AF/AE tracking when shooting with the electronic shutter, and up to approximately 12 fps with AF/AE tracking when shooting with the electronic 1st curtain2. Thanks to these capabilities, users can capture high-quality images.\n\nThe EOS R50 features crop-less 6K-oversampled high-quality 4K video. What’s more, the camera is equipped with a variety of convenient video recording features, including a “Close-up Demo Mode” for highlighting the attractiveness of products when recording review videos, as well as a “Movie IS Mode” that makes possible more natural Vlog shooting, thereby meeting a wide range of user needs.\n\n",

      "description": "Thanks to a full-frame CMOS sensor with an effective pixel count of approximately 24.2 million1, as well as a DIGIC X image processor, the EOS R8 realizes high image quality and enables exquisite background blur, high dynamic range and other means of rich expression only possible with full-frame cameras. In addition, the camera’s high standard sensitivity of ISO 102400 (when shooting still images) provides freedom of visual expression even in nighttime and low-light indoor environment. What’s more, the camera is easily portable, measuring just approximately 132.5 mm (W) x 86.1 mm (H) x 70.0 mm (D) and weighing approximately 461g—the lightest model in Canon’s EOS R series of full-frame mirrorless cameras2.\n\nInheriting the high basic performance of the EOS R6 Mark II, the EOS R8 features high-speed, high-accuracy autofocus (AF) over a wide shooting range, as well as AF/AE tracking that enables high-speed shooting of up to approximately 40 frames per second (FPS)3 when using the electronic shutter. In addition, the camera is capable of shooting crop-less 4K/60P video with 6K oversampling and FHD/180P high-framerate video4. With the new “movie pre-recording” function5 that can capture a scene from 5 seconds or 3 seconds before the user’s recording cue, the EOS R8 also serves the growing need for video recording capabilities tailored to such formats as vlogs and social media.\n\n",

      "description": "The XL1 features an exclusive XL lens-mount system which, when used with an optional EF mount adapter, allows the camcorder to utilize a range of Canon’s extensive lineup of EF lenses for EOS 35mm cameras. It also accommodates an optional 1.6x XL extender which increases lens magnification by 60%.\n\nThe camcorder is supplied with a 16x optical zoom XL5.5-88mm IS lens which delivers exceptionally clear, sharp images and resolves over 600 TV lines. The high-performance lens also supports Canon’s new SuperRange image stabilizer, which virtually eliminates the effects of low-frequency vibrations. The new system improves upon the conventional gyro-sensor method by also employing a motion vector to detect vibrations, offering even greater image-stabilizing performance.\n\nThe XL1 uses a 3-CCD system with separate 1/3″ CCD image sensors for processing each primary color: red, green and blue. Light that passes through the lens is separated by a prism into its primary components and is sent to its own CCD. The process achieves outstanding detail and faithful color reproduction.\n\nThe camcorder also employs advanced CCD technology called Pixel Shift, which realizes improved video signal, including a wider dynamic range, low color noise, excellent color reproduction, and high resolution. By horizontally shifting the green CCD by one-half pixel and then electronically shifting the green signal vertically by one pixel, Pixel Shift maximizes the system’s 270,000-pixel CCDs, achieving high resolution comparable to 410,000-pixel CCD systems. Canon has chosen to utilize larger-sized pixels in each CCD to deliver outstanding results when shooting in super low-light situations.",

      "description": "The Canon FV1 meets the demands of a wide user base, combining easy operation and a compact, lightweight design, with the advantages and versatility of digital imaging. The model captures both movie and still images, offers manual function control as well as automatic exposure and focusing modes, includes a variety of digital effects, and has an auto-editing feature.\n\nThe Canon FV1’s lens shift image-stabilizing system was adapted from technology originally developed by Canon for use in autofocus lenses for the company’s EOS line of single-lens-reflex cameras. The system utilizes a vibration-detection gyro sensor which, when camera shake occurs, emits electronic signals that shift the image- stabilizing lens group to deliver consistently smooth, steady video images. The newly developed lens unit incorporates a compact, high- performance aspherical lens element and contributes to the FV1’s compact, lightweight body. Furthermore, unlike electronic image- stabilizing methods commonly used by other manufacturers, the lens shift system optically corrects camera shake, resulting in absolutely no degradation of image resolution.",

      "description": "The stylish PV1 delivers superior imaging performance despite its small, sleek design. The model is equipped with an Optical Image Stabilizer employing Canon’s original lens shift image-stabilizing technology. The system compensates for camera shake-a common occurrence when shooting by hand or in a moving vehicle-to ensure smooth, steady, natural-looking images in all shooting modes. The innovative lens-shift system also contributes to the camcorder’s compact, lightweight body and, unlike electronic image-stabilizing methods used in competitive models, optically corrects camera shake, resulting in absolutely no degradation of image resolution.\n\nA Progressive Scan CCD image sensor realizes high-resolution video and still images. Each and every light-gathering pixel on the CCD is used to produce a full-frame video image 60 times per second. Conventional interlace-type CCDs only create a half frame of image data alternately every 60th of a second, which can result in an annoying image flicker on the television screen when the playback is paused. By contrast, Canon’s Progressive Scan CCD enables users to capture sharp, blur-free still images even when shooting rapidly moving subjects.",

Employing Canon’s state-of- the-art lens technology, it comprises a fluorite element, which realizes virtually ideal correction of chromatic aberrations. The exclusive Canon lens realizes image quality that rivals professional equipment, making possible 20x optical zoom with sharp images free of color-blur.\n\nThe camcorder’s three 1/4″ CCD image sensors deliver high sensitivity and a high dynamic range. Each CCD separately processes each of the three primary colors red, green and blue. Light that passes through the lens is separated by a beam-splitting optical prism into its primary components and is sent to its own CCD. The process achieves outstanding detail and faithful color reproduction.\n\nAdvanced CCD technology called Pixel Shift realizes outstanding clarity, natural color, a wide dynamic range, reduced vertical smear and crisp still images. By horizontally shifting the green CCD by one-half pixel and then electronically shifting the green signal vertically by one pixel, Pixel Shift maximizes the system’s 270,000-pixel CCDs, achieving high resolution comparable to 410,000-pixel CCD systems.",

      "description": "The Canon FV10, compact and lightweight with a sophisticated body design, was developed to make digital video available to a wider user base. The model is equipped with a full array of advanced features that, when combined with its affordability, delivers outstanding cost performance.\n\nIn addition to making full use of the compactness possibilities offered by the DV standard, the new camcorder is equipped with Canon’s originally developed compact camera-signal-processing LSI and a compact mechanical chassis. These features combine to realize a body measuring a mere 5.7 (w) x 10.1 (h) x 12.9 (d) cm and weighing only 550 grams.\n\nThe FV10 features a graceful, curving body design with a sleek metallic-finish exterior. Translucent highlights, located on the camcorder’s front panel, the operation buttons on the side, and the frame of the flip-out view screen, in addition to a metal ring surrounding the lens, add stylish, refined accents.\n\nThe lens of the new Canon camcorder incorporates two aspherical lens elements, which correct for spherical aberrations and distortion, and delivers 10x optical zoom. The digital zoom feature further extends the magnification to 200x. The FV10 also features image stabilization, which cancels out the effects of camera shake to ensure smooth, steady images, even when shooting in the telephoto range.",

Each and every light-gathering pixel on the CCD is used to produce a full-frame video image, making possible exceptionally sharp still images. When shooting with the Digital Motor Drive function (Progressive Mode), the IXY DV can record full-frame still images continuously at 30 frames per second, allowing users to select any particular shot from a taped sequence for use as a sharp, blur-free still image.\n\nThe inclusion of a slot for the MMC (MultiMediaCard), an industry standard storage media, facilitates the recording and transfer of still images. Using the IXY DV’s specially incorporated independent Photo Button, users can easily shoot and record on MMC vivid digital still images and then, using a PC card adapter, download them to a computer.\n\nThe ultra-compact lens of the new Canon camcorder incorporates two aspherical lens elements and delivers 10x optical zoom and, through the digital zoom function, 40x digital zoom. The model also features image stabilization, which cancels out the effects of camera shake to ensure smooth and steady videos, even when shooting in the telephoto range.",

      "description": "The PV130 combines the benefits of a megapixel CCD with optical image stabilization. Unlike electronic image stabilizing methods, optical image stabilization corrects for camera shake with absolutely no degradation of image quality, so not only does the PV130 make possible smooth, steady, blur-free images when shooting movies, but also when taking still shots, distinguishing the model from camcorders that utilize electronic means of image stabilization. Accordingly, Canon’s PV130 makes possible the capture of high-quality 1.25-million-pixel blur-free still images throughout the entire zoom range, recording the image data on either a MultiMedia Card or SD (Secure Digital) Card.\n\nThe PV130 is equipped with a newly developed large-diameter video lens with 10x optical zoom that is the industry’s first to incorporate a glass molded aspherical lens element with a high index of refraction. It also incorporates a six-blade iris diaphragm that makes possible rich, natural blur effects comparable to those achieved using a single lens reflex camera. When shooting movies, the lens, combined with the camcorder’s 1.33-megapixel CCD sensor and optical image stabilizer, resolves 520 horizontal TV lines for high-quality, high-resolution images.\n\nThe sleek body design of the new Canon camcorder features a magnesium-alloy exterior with anodized aluminum highlights. An oval design motif employed in such areas as the operating buttons and product markings adds a distinctive stylistic touch to the model’s refined look and feel.",

The IXY DV 2 maintains the same compact size and stylish design as its predecessor while offering improved functionality and ease of use. As newly introduced features, the new Canon camcorder permits the storage of still images on either SD or MultiMedia memory cards while an Extended Recording function allows users to extend tape recording times up to three-fold.\nLike the original IXY DV, the new model incorporates a 680,000-pixel (360,000 effective pixels) Progressive Scan CCD sensor equipped with an RGB color filter, which separates light passing through the lens into individual red, green and blue color components to realize a level of natural color reproduction that approaches that of more advanced 3-CCD camcorders. Each and every light-gathering pixel on the CCD is used to produce a full-frame video image, making possible exceptionally sharp still images. When shooting with the Digital Motor Drive function (Progressive Mode), the IXY DV 2 can record full-frame still images continuously at 30 frames per second, allowing users to select any particular shot from a taped sequence for use as a sharp, blur-free still image.\nThe Canon IXY DV 2 features an ergonomic body design that fits snugly in the user’s hand and operational switch placement that balances maximum functionality with handling ease. In addition to outstanding portability, the model achieves superlative holding performance and operating ease.",

      "description": "The IXY DV 3, measuring just 11.1 (h) x 5.0 (w) x 8.9 (d) cm and weighing 380 grams (body only), incorporates an array of miniaturization innovations to realize exceptional portability. Incorporating a 1/6″ 680,000-pixel interlaced CCD and complementary color filter, the unit enables users to capture high-quality still images at up to XGA (1,024 x 768 pixels) resolution in standard, fine and super fine compression modes, as well as record video. Canon’s new proprietary camera-signal-processing LSI (large-scale integrated) circuit contributes to natural color reproduction rivaling that achieved with a primary color filter. Furthermore, the LSI circuit assumes that tape-recorded images will be displayed on TV monitors and card-recorded images printed out in a manner akin to images captured using a Canon digital camera, and automatically optimizes color processing accordingly to ensure vivid high-quality color reproduction in either mode.\n\nThe new model features an ergonomic design for hand-held comfort and control button placement that balances maximum functionality with operational ease. A color viewfinder, tilted upward to allow a natural viewing posture, facilitates shooting in bright sunlight or other conditions less suited for view screen use. Styled with a silver-colored metallic casing and a body shape that highlights the unit’s lens, the IXY DV 3 achieves a refined look distinguished by blue color accents around the viewfinder and front panel.\n\nCanon’s new camcorder accommodates both MMC (MultiMediaCard) and SD (Secure Digital) memory card recording-media formats for the easy and convenient capturing of digital still images. Once captured, still images can be downloaded effortlessly to a personal computer using the USB cable supplied with the optional AK-210 accessory pack, or using a commercially available PC card adapter or card reader unit. The IXY DV 3 also connects via a dedicated cable directly to Canon’s CP-10 compact card photo printer for high quality color prints without having to use a personal computer.\n\nThe IXY DV 3 digital camcorder enables the card-based recording of video in the Motion-JPEG (MJPEG) format, making it possible for users to download video clips to a personal computer and distribute their images easily as e-mail attachments.",

      "description": "The Canon XV2 features a high-performance Video L (Luxury)-series lens with a large 20x optical-zoom range, offering a focal length of up to the equivalent of 790mm in 35mm format.\n\nThe Canon XV2 employs a new 3CCD image-sensor system, with a separate 1/4″ CCD for each of the primary colors red, green and blue, to deliver high sensitivity and a high dynamic range. The system uses a beam-splitting optical prism to separate light that passes through the lens into its primary components and sends each color to its own 410,000-pixel (380,000 effective pixels) CCD. Compared to camcorders that utilize a single CCD, the 3CCD system achieves outstanding detail and faithful color reproduction, from basic primary colors to subtle mid-range tones. When recording video, advanced CCD technology called Pixel Shift effectively boosts resolution by shifting the green CCD horizontally and vertically by one-half pixel each. The process achieves a high resolution comparable to a 550,000-pixel CCD system and realizes a horizontal resolution of 540 TV lines- the highest level possible in the DV (Digital Video) standard. Furthermore, Canon’s high-sensitivity CCD sensors and new generation camera-signal-processing LSI circuit combine to achieve a dramatic improvement in sensitivity in low light conditions.\n\nCanon’s XV2 camcorder also features a Photo mode, enabling users to capture high-definition digital stills. In Photo mode Canon’s Pixel Shift technology and mechanical shutter combine to realize a high image resolution of around 1.68 megapixels (1,488 pixels x 1,128 pixels) for detailed image capture. Canon’s Cross-Layout Stereo Microphone newly features three frequency response modes- Normal, Voice and Wind Cut- as well as a full range of manual settings, such as independent dial adjustment of left and right channel input levels, enabling users to optimize audio settings for the shooting environment.\n\nDesigned to meet the needs of professional users, Canon’s XV2 digital camcorder newly incorporates many of the manual settings and advanced operating functions found in the company’s highly appraised top-of-the-line interchangeable-lens model XL1S, released in July 2001.",

      "description": "Unlike electronic image stabilizing methods, the new IXY DV M’s Optical Image Stabilizer corrects for camera shake without causing any degradation of image quality, making possible smooth, steady, blur-free images when taking still shots, as well as when shooting movies. As a result, the IXY DV M realizes high-quality 1.23-million-pixel blur-free still images throughout the entire zoom range.\n\nFeaturing a sleek vertical design, the IXY DV M is equipped with a newly developed compact video lens with 10x optical zoom.\n\nFurthermore, Canon’s proprietary MACS (Multi Architecture Camera System) camera-signal-processing LSI (large-scale integrated circuit) processes movie and still signals separately, contributing to natural color reproduction. The LSI automatically assumes that tape-recorded images will be displayed on TV monitors and card-recorded images printed out, optimizing color processing accordingly to ensure vivid high-quality color reproduction in either mode.\n\nCanon’s new camcorder also supports Camera Direct printing of still shots captured on memory cards. Requiring only a single proprietary cable connection between the camcorder and Canon Card Photo Printers CP-10 and CP-100, or Ink Jet Printers BJ 895PD and BJ 535 PD (all sold separately), Camera Direct eliminates the need for a PC in the print process by enabling users to control print settings directly from the camcorder’s LCD screen.\n\nFurther enhancing still photography performance, the IXY DV M also supports the Exif Print (Exif 2.2) standard defined and controlled by JEITA (Japan Electronics and Information Technologies Industries Association).\n\nThe IXY DV M’s Accessory Kit AK-550 (sold separately) includes Canon’s DV Messenger communication software, supporting visual and audio communication as a “TV-phone” when the camcorder is connected to the Internet*. DV Messenger software enables users to remotely control from their PC the functions of the Canon camcorder** being used by the person with whom they are communicating. In addition, it allows the users to exchange digital still-image files and view movies recorded on each other’s camcorder.",

      "description": "The Canon FV M1 digital video camcorder, the company’s flagship single-CCD model, meets the exacting demands of high-amateur users with outstanding image quality and shooting features, whether taking still shots or shooting movies.\n\nAdvanced imaging technology includes a high-resolution 2.2-megapixel CCD sensor and an RGB primary color filter, which achieves more accurate color reproduction with finer gradations than conventional complementary color filters. Moreover, the FV M1 features Canon’s proprietary DIGIC DV image processor.\n\nThe camcorder is equipped with a high-resolution Canon zoom lens that maximizes the full potential of the 2.2-megapixel CCD as well as enabling up to 11x optical magnification. Incorporating an Optical Image Stabilizer, the lens automatically corrects for camera shake without causing any degradation of image quality, making possible smooth, steady images throughout the entire zoom range. Opening creative possibilities, a six-blade iris diaphragm allows users to employ natural background blur effects usually achieved using SLR cameras.\n\nFor the first time in a Canon camcorder, the FV M1 offers true 16:9 wide-format shooting for full-screen reproduction on wide-screen televisions without any loss of image quality. Moreover, optical image stabilization means that wide-format images can be recorded free of blur, even when filmed by hand.\n\nRealizing outstanding performance, the FV M1 features a bright 3.5″ LCD monitor for viewing ease, a user-friendly mode dial that makes it simple to set shooting conditions.\n\nThe FV M1 digital video camcorder is compatible with the PictBridge industry standard established by the Camera & Imaging Products Association (CIPA) for the direct printing of photos from digital cameras. In addition to Canon’s range of Direct Print-compatible printers, users can connect the camcorders directly to any printer enabled for PictBridge and output photos (JPEG) without having to use a computer.",

      "description": "The stylish Canon FV50 is a compact, lightweight camcorder well suited for family use. Featuring a powerful 22x optical-zoom lens, the unit enables high-quality image capture of distant subjects, ideal for recording events such as school-entrance and graduation ceremonies. The model’s ergonomic body offers reduced proportions to increase handheld comfort and make long shooting sessions stress-free. Also, a fully automatic shooting mode and the grouping of the most frequently used control buttons on the side of the unit make operation a snap even for first-time users.\nIncorporating a high-definition 1/6″ 680,000-pixel interlaced CCD, the FV50 enables users to capture high-quality video, as well as still images, at up to XGA (1,024 x 768 pixels) resolution. Further enhancing imaging performance is Canon’s proprietary DIGIC DV image processor. DIGIC DV automatically assumes that tape-recorded images will be displayed on TV monitors and card-recorded images printed out or viewed on a PC and, processing stills and video separately, optimizes color processing to ensure vivid, high-quality color performance to suit the viewing environment.\nThe Canon FV50 also ships with the Wide Conversion Attachment WA-30.5, which attaches to the front of the lens for an even wider angle (0.6x) of coverage, extending the field of view for use in more confined indoors spaces. Further catering to the varied needs of family users, the camcorder offers low-light shooting options, including Super Night Mode and Night+ Mode, to enhance image sensitivity and capture capability. Automatically sensing insufficient ambient light, Super Night Mode emits a bright LED light as supplemental illumination to enable color video recording in virtual darkness. Night+ Mode places control with users, allowing them to activate the LED light when and for as long as they choose.\nThe FV50’s high-performance lens incorporates a double-sided aspherical lens element that effectively corrects for a variety of lens aberrations to deliver sharp imaging performance despite the high zoom ratio, while also enabling a compact lens-unit design. The camcorder also features an Image Stabilizer that cancels out the effects of camera shake to ensure smooth and steady video images, even when shooting in the telephoto range. Canon’s FV50 digital video camcorder is compatible with the.",

      "description": "In response to increasing demand for digital video camcorders that can capture high-quality digital still shots in addition to movies, the FV M100 features a high-resolution 1.33million-pixel CCD image sensor, enabling superlative video and still-image recording. Equipped with Canon’s proprietary DIGIC DV image processor, which processes stills and video separately, the new camcorder optimizes color processing to ensure vivid, high-quality color performance in either mode.\nThe FV M100 camcorder incorporates a range of advanced Canon optical technology that enables high image quality as well as compact dimensions, including a newly developed 18x zoom lens, that make it ideal for capturing distant subjects at such events as school-entrance and graduation ceremonies. Canon’s lens coatings further contribute to the reproduction of clear, sharply defined images that capitalize on the full potential of the model’s megapixel-class CCD sensor.\nTo further simplify the printing of digital still shots, the FV M100 offers Canon’s new Print/Share button. Once the camcorder is connected to a compatible printer via a single USB connection, the Print/Share button automatically lights up to indicate that the unit is ready to print photos or transfer files to a PC with just one push.Canon’s new digital video camcorder is also compatible with the PictBridge industry standard for the direct printing of photos from digital cameras. In addition to Canon’s range of Direct Print-compatible printers, users can connect the camcorder directly to any printer enabled for PictBridge and output photos (JPEG) from the SD Memory Card without having to use a computer.\nThe FV M100 digital video camcorder features a stylish high-gloss metallic finish with design accents on the lens ring and other areas for a sophisticated air. The ergonomic body offers an enhanced grip design for increased handheld comfort and a non-slip finish for sure finger placement, making even long shooting sessions less tiring.\nThe new system enables the recording of high-resolution video in the 16:9 wide format, making possible full-screen playback on wide-screen TVs without any loss of image quality. Unlike methods that vertically crop and digitally enlarge the picture to fit the screen, the FV M100’s 16:9 shooting mode uses the recording pixels on either side of the standard 4:3 effective-pixel area, employing the full width of the CCD for a naturally larger horizontal angle of view.\nOther performance-enhancing features include: Continuous Shooting, capable of capturing up to 10 consecutive images at five frames per second in resolution equivalent to SXGA (1,280 x 960 pixels); Super Night Mode which, sensing insufficient ambient light, automatically emits a bright LED light as supplemental illumination to enable color video recording in virtual darkness; and Night+ Mode, which allows users to activate the LED light when and for as long as they choose.\nFor the first time in Canon’s digital video camcorder lineup, the FV M100 camcorder offers users three body color variations – silver, champagne gold, and rosé – enabling a color choice to suit personal preference.",

Featuring a stylish high-gloss metallic finish in two-tone silver, chic metallic buttons and switches, and an ergonomic rounded grip design, the camcorder incorporates a range of design innovations that enhance performance and operability.\nCanon’s FV M20 camcorder incorporates a variety of advanced features to enable the capture of high-quality video and still images, including a 2.2-megapixel CCD, RGB primary color filter and Canon’s proprietary DIGIC DV image processor. Canon’s lens coatings further contribute to the reproduction of clear, sharply defined images throughout the zoom range and capitalize on the full potential of the modelsEhigh-resolution CCD sensors.\nUtilizing the full potential of the CCD, the new systems enable the recording of high-resolution video in the 16:9 wide format, making possible full-screen playback on wide-screen TVs without any loss of image quality. Unlike methods that vertically crop and digitally enlarge the picture to fit the screen, the “true” 16:9 shooting mode uses the recording pixels on either side of the standard 4:3 effective-pixel area, employing the full width of the CCD for a naturally larger horizontal angle of view. Also, matching high-impact images with quality sound for the increasingly sophisticated home theatre environment, the FV M20 incorporates a new digital audio chip that offers improved audio processing, and enables such features as Manual Audio Level Control.\nThe FV M20 includes such advanced new digital photography features as high-speed continuous shooting at up to three frames per second, auto exposure bracketing, selectable focus points, and horizontal and vertical image trimming. To further simplify the printing of digital still shots, the models also offer Canon’s Print/Share button and PictBridge direct printing compatibility. In addition to Canon’s range of Direct Print-compatible inkjet and dye sublimation printers, the models can be connected directly to any other printer enabled for PictBridge.\nOPTURA 30/MVX20i’s specifications is the same as OPTURA 40/MVX25i, but with a 12x zoom lens.",

      "description": "The Canon XL2 succeeds the XL1S, which has garnered high praise in the market since its launch in July 2001. Inheriting the outstanding integrated design and innovative features of its predecessor, the XL2 boasts vastly improved image quality, functionality and operability to meet the performance needs of professional videographers.\n\nCanon’s XL2 camcorder employs a progressive-scan 3-CCD image-sensor system, which assigns a separate 1/3″ 680,000-pixel CCD image sensor*1 to each primary color – red, green and blue – for outstanding detail and faithful color reproduction. The model also incorporates advanced CCD technology called Horizontal Pixel Shift which, by horizontally shifting the green CCD one-half pixel, effectively increases the system’s total pixel count by half to achieve a horizontal resolution of 540 TV lines – the highest level possible in the DV standard. Moreover, a newly developed signal processing LSI (large-scale integrated circuit) optimizes color-space reproduction and boosts processing speed for greatly enhanced image quality.\n\nOffering improved wide-screen performance, the XL2’s high-resolution 16:9 Wide TV Mode effectively uses the wide area of the CCD to capture true 16:9 wide-screen images. When recording the images to tape, the system employs the Electronic Anamorphic method to then “squeeze” the horizontal aspect and record the images in the standard 4:3 aspect ratio. When the images are replayed on a wide-screen television, they are “stretched” back again to fit the wider format. Capturing 2.5 times as many pixels as the XL1S when recording in 16:9 mode, the XL2 achieves minimal degradation of image quality compared with the cropping method used previously.\n\nThe Canon XL2 features the exclusive XL interchangeable lens-mount system, which enables users to select the most appropriate lens for each individual shooting situation. In addition to exclusive interchangeable video lenses, when outfitted with an optional EF mount adapter, the system also permits the use of a range of Canon EF lenses for EOS 35mm SLR cameras.\n\nThe camcorder also offers videographers an expanded choice of shooting modes with which to achieve their creative objectives. In addition to the 60i (60 fields per second, interlaced) standard-video and 30p (30 frames per second, progressive) modes of its predecessor, the Canon XL2 offers a “cinema look” 24p (24 frames per second, progressive) mode, which uses the same frame rate as movie film. While the 60i video mode is suited to recording news, sports and documentaries, the 24p and 30p modes are ideal for recording movies and television dramas, where the look and feel of film is usually desired. The camcorder also offers a wide variety of new image quality adjustment functions that enable video images to more closely resemble film, including a film grain adjustment, and gamma and color matrix settings in a choice of two modes: “video” and “cinema.”\n\nA range of new features and enhancements has been incorporated into the XL2 in order to better respond to the needs of professional users, including: the industry-standard SMPTE (Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers) time code; a 15-item Custom Preset, which permits users to activate their preset picture control settings at the press of a button; dual XLR audio inputs, which supply 48-volt phantom power to microphones; and a host of manual functions for improved performance and ease of use.",

      "description": "Canon’s HD Video Camera Recorder XL H1 is the newest addition to the company’s XL-series of digital video camcorders, which have garnered high acclaim in the market since first being introduced in February 1998. While maintaining the outstanding integrated design and innovative features for which the XL-series is renowned, the XL H1 delivers high performance and outstanding digital image quality to meet the needs of professional videographers.\n\nCanon’s newly developed DIGIC DV II image engine and an HD Codec LSI (large-scale integrated circuit) make possible the recording and playback of high-resolution Hi-Vision HDV*1 1080i images on miniDV-format video tape. Additionally, the new XL H1’s 1/3″ 1.67-megapixel 3-CCD imaging sensor system*2 achieves outstanding detail and faithful color reproduction.\n\nThe Canon XL H1 digital video camcorder comes equipped with the company’s newly developed HD-20x zoom Video Lens XL 5.4-108 mm L IS II. The new lens employs a fluorite lens element, which corrects residual chromatic aberration that optical glass lens elements cannot entirely remove, and incorporates two aspherical lens elements with high-refractive glass to effectively correct for a variety of aberrations throughout the zoom range.\n\nFurther contributing to exceptional Hi-Vision imaging performance, the new XL H1 camcorder’s lens system features a newly developed SR Coat that reduces ghosting in addition to fully multi-coated lenses. Moreover, Canon’s SuperRange optical image stabilization system enables the detection and correction of low-frequency vibrations often missed by conventional optical systems, without incurring any degradation in image quality.\n\nThe Canon XL H1 features the exclusive XL interchangeable lens-mount system, which enables users to select the most appropriate lens for each individual shooting situation. In addition to exclusive interchangeable video lenses, when outfitted with an optional EF mount adapter XL, the system also permits the use of a range of Canon EF lenses*3 for the company’s EOS series of SLR cameras.\n\nCanon’s XL H1 is the first*4 HDV-format video camcorder to incorporate broadcast industry standard HD-SDI (Serial Digital Interface) output connectors, allowing non-compressed output of Hi-Vision image data. In addition, a range of new features and enhancements have been incorporated into the new XL H1 to better respond to the needs of professional users, including a TIME CODE input connector and output connector that enables synchronization of time code data on footage taken by multiple video cameras or recorders, as well as a GENLOCK input connector that prevents image distortion when switching the video feed source.\n\nThe Canon XL H1 video camcorder is equipped with several other advanced functions, starting with a “cinema look” 24F (24 frames per second) mode which uses the same frame rate as movie film. The camcorder also offers a wide variety of image quality adjustment functions that enable video images to more closely resemble film, including sharpness adjustment, and gamma and color matrix settings. Moreover, the new XL H1 is the first XL-series camcorder model to feature a still image shooting function using an SD Memory Card or a MultiMediaCard.\n\n",

Boasting a slimmed-down body size, shedding 15mm in width, 2mm in depth, and 1mm in height, and weighing in at about 370 grams-130 grams less than its predecessor-the FV M300 offers users vastly improved portability.\n\nDespite its compact size, the FV M300 packs a powerful punch with such high-performance shooting features as a 20x zoom lens, a high-resolution 1.33 million-pixel* CCD image sensor, and the company’s proprietary high-speed DIGIC DV image processor. Moreover, contributing to the increased functionality and operability of the new camcorder model are twin white LEDs, which allow high-contrast color recording even in low light conditions, and a built-in lens cover that facilitates easy one-touch operation.",

      "description": "DC40 offers outstanding performance and innovative design features as the flagship DVD model in the company’s “Photo DV” video camcorder lineup. The DC40 realizes outstanding image resolution and rich color gradation through a variety of advanced features, including a class-leading* 4.3-megapixel CCD sensor**, an RGB primary color filter, Canon’s proprietary DIGIC DV image processor, and a Canon 10x zoom lens.\n\nCanon’s new DVD video camcorder embodies the beauty of simplicity of form with a distinctive and attractive rounded body shape, based on the Curvature Design method, which has become the signature look of the DC series.\n\nIn addition to its luxurious styling, which offers hand-held comfort supporting easy accessibility to the 8cm DVD-R/RW media, the new camcorder boasts superior operability. The DC40 is the first Canon video camcorder to incorporate a power-driven built-in lens cover that automatically opens when the power is switched on and closes when recording has stopped. The model, which enables high-resolution capture of both video and still images, also gives users the convenient option of saving photo images either to a miniSD memory card or DVD. Alternatively, users can take advantage of high-speed transfer of photo images to a memory card and then later save them onto the DVD media.",

      "description": "The advertisement about “Kwanon,” a prototype of the Japanese produced 35mm rangefinder camera was appeared in the Asahi Camera magazine. It was June 1934 and the ad was placed by Seiki-Kogaku Kenkyusho (Precision Optical Instruments Laboratory), the forerunner of Canon Inc. Seiki-Kogaku was started to develop the KWANON which was conceived by Goro Yoshida (1900-1993). Germany’s Leica and Contax were already well-established makers of high-end 35mm cameras when Yoshida pursued his dream of the ideal Japan-made 35mm camera.\nThere were supposedly four variants of the Kwanon camera. However, none is thought to exist today. Yoshida was a believer in Kannon, the Buddhist Goddess of Mercy. The name “Kwanon” came from this Goddess’ name. The lens which came with the camera was named “Kasyapa” which came from Mahakashapa, a disciple of the Buddha.",

      "description": "Billed as the successor to the Canon S II, this camera was first called the “S IIb.” The designation was soon changed to “II B.”The hallmark feature was the three-mode optical viewfinder. It had a positive and negative lens element in an optical block which rotated to change the viewfinder magnification. A lever could set one of three magnifications from 0.67x to 1.5x to match the focal length of the interchangeable lens. This feature received very high acclaim.\nThe lens mount was a universal, threaded flange compatible with Leica. Later in the production, a new diecast body was used to maintain precision and improve mass productivity. Development of the fast Serenar 50mm f/1.9 lens (6 elements in 4 groups, Gauss-type) was also completed and bundled with the II B as the standard lens.",

The beam reflected by the subject was received by the pin photo diode. A triangulation was thereby created in the same way as with an optical coincidence rangefinder. The lens draw is adjusted automatically to match the subject distance for focusing. The near-infrared beam also enabled focusing under low-light conditions, making the camera a hit product. The name “Autoboy” became synonymous with AF compact cameras.",

      "description": "Instead of being a next-generation successor to the F-1, this camera was called the “New F-1,” and not the “F-2.” With the first F-1 in 1971, Canon promised that the camera would remain unchanged for 10 years. This promise was fulfilled. During those ten years, there were remarkable advances in electronics, precision manufacturing, and optics. The successor to the top-of-the-line F-1 had to incorporate the best electronic technology for better automation, versatility, and specifications.\n\nFor metering flexibility, the New F-1 uses interchangeable focusing screens to change the metering pattern with a segmented metering element. For automation, system AE is incorporated for optimum operation. The camera’s basic controls are also the same as the old F-1 so F-1 users can easily adapt to the New F-1.",

Two years later, this amount shrank by more than 30 percent to 5.37 million units.\n\nAmid such market conditions, the Canon T50 was introduced as a wave-of-the-future 35mm SLR camera. It was the first T-series camera. The camera was designed to respond to the user automatically. It was easy to use and anybody could take pictures with it. It had a power winder (which was well received on the Autoboy) and TTL program AE. In 1983, the T50 won the Good Design Award from the Ministry of International Trade and Industry.\n\nThere is the limited model as T5 in only USA.",

      "description": "Developed as the top-of-the-line T-series camera, the T90 is a multi-mode SLR with built-in motor drive. The form of the pentaprism hump is a distinct characteristic. Instead of being sharp-edged like on previous cameras, it is rounded with smooth curves. The camera was designed to lessen the picture-taking burden on the user via automation. It aimed for seamless operation to respond to the user’s will. A lot of top-notch technology and thought went into the camera.\n\nThe camera has three metering systems to suit diverse shooting conditions. Eight auto-exposure modes and two manual exposure modes also make the camera highly versatile. Drive operations are divided among three small coreless motors to consume less power. With four size-AA batteries, the built-in motor drive can shoot at a maximum of 4.5 fps. It was truly a top-of-the-line camera. In Japan, the camera’s nickname was “Tank.”",

      "description": "The successor to the EOS-1 and the new top-of-the-line EOS camera. With a cross-type BASIS for the AF sensor, the camera offers five focusing points which can be selected automatically or manually. The wide focusing area makes it easier to focus track moving subjects in the predictive AI Servo AF mode. The camera matches well with super telephoto lenses having a built-in USM (Ultrasonic Motor) for silent and fast operation. Exposures can be compensated in 1/2-stop or 1/3-stop increments for higher precision. The EOS-1N is highly rated by pro photographers. Very reliable and durable with a lifespan of 100,000 shutter cycles. The mechanical operation has also been refined for silent operation.",

Although some say that the camera was marketed in October 1935, the marketing date was February 1936. The lens was a Nikkor 5cm f/3.5 mounted for the first time on a civilian camera. The rangefinder optics and focusing mount were made by Nippon Kogaku. The viewfinder was a reversed Galilean type and it was separate from the rangefinder window. The viewfinder was nicknamed “surprise box” because it popped up when a button was pressed. Saburo Uchida, Goro Yoshida’s brother-in-law and manager of the company’s business affairs, changed the “KWANON” name to “Canon.” “Canon” also refers to the Bible and standards or laws. “Hansa” was (and still is) the trademark of Omiya Photo Supply, the distributor of the Hansa Canon.",

      "description": "A high-end SLR camera for professionals and advanced amateurs. This camera has many innovative features such as 45-point Area AF, high-speed and precision Eye Controlled Focus, and 7 fps high-speed predictive AF continuous shooting mode. The EOS3 is a camera which can fully respond to the photographer’s intention. It retains many of the features and operability of EOS-1N while also incorporating various recommendations and requests submitted by EOS-1N and EOS 5 users. It also reflects a variety of recent trends and developments in the SLR industry. This model has 45-point Area AF by Canon’s originally developed CMOS sensor and new focusing optical system. This AF system offers high subject-capturing and unrestricted framing capability. Eye Controlled Focus, refined to make it almost twice as fast and more precise than before together with 45-point Area AF system bring EOS3’s high-performance AF system another step closer to the human eye. The 21-zone evaluative metering linked to the focusing points, multi-spot metering with up to eight readings per exposure and eight metering system, including E-TTL autoflash with 550Ex are applied to this camera as well. The superb operability is achieved by dual electronic dials, 18 custom functions and firm grip holding, using the same material and design as EOS-1N. The same level of protection against moisture and dust as EOS-1N and silent film rewind are also provided. The high-performance 1/8000sec. shutter unit passed Canon’s standard endurance test of 100,000 times shutter cycle. System accessories launched at the same time as the camera include Power Drive Booster PB-E2, Ni-MH Pack NP-E2, Speedlite 550EX, Remote Switches with better clip-on operability and an anti-fog eyepiece. The nine Ec- series focusing screens for EOS-1N are compatible.",

Based on the concept of “easier to use and more comfortable” than the former model, it is smaller and lighter weight. It also has a higher performance AF system, exposure control and other basic features. A seven focusing-point wide-view AF system is used instead of the conventional three focusing-point AF. The focusing speed is equivalent to that of the EOS 55/ELAN II E/50E. This camera has 35-zone evaluative metering instead of the conventional 6-zone metering, E-TTL flash exposure control linked to an active focusing point, and other basic features, such as easy depth of field preview , higher speed of 1.5 fps film advance, shorter viewfinder black-out time, mid-roll film rewind button and a wireless remote control (Japanese model only). The camera is compact, but the command dial, the main dial, an external LCD display, and a small, yet comfortable grip ensure a good handling of the camera. The camera body is two-tone silver and black. The Battery Pack PB-200 for size-AA batteries with a vertical-grip shutter button is separately available (4,500 yen). New lenses marketed at the same time are: EF28-80mm f/3.5- 5.6 V USM, EF28-80mm f/3.5-5.6 II (export only), EF75-300mm f/4-5.6 III USM and EF75-300mm f/4-5.6 III (export only).\n\nThe black model was introduced in Japanese market in September, 2000.",

      "description": "The EOS-1V, successor to the EOS-1N, is a premier-class professional SLR featuring the latest state-of-the-art technology.\n\nPremier AF Performance: The 45-point area AF gives predictive AI servo AF at about 9 fps (with the PB-E2 attached) for outstanding subject tracking and blazingly fast focusing, all automatically.\n\nHigh-speed continuous shooting: 10 fps continuously (with the PB-E2 attached).\nIn response to the severe demands of professional photographers, already excellent reliability has been improved even further. Water and dust resistance is even better than the EOS-1N and EOS-3. Leading-edge “thixo-molding” metal injection molding technology has led to strong, rigid magnesium alloy outer covers that easily passed 150,000 operations test standards. While carrying over the standard specifications of the EOS-1: the advanced exposure metering system of the EOS-3 has been incorporated in this professional camera, along with the 1/8000 sec. high speed shutter that syncs with flash at 1/250 second.\n\nThe viewfinder specifications are carried over from the EOS-1N, and EOS-1N accessories are compatible.\n\nShooting data recording system: Shooting data for 100 rolls of 36 exp. film (using the standard settings) is stored in memory, and can be read and edited on a computer using the ES-E1 software. Customizing functions abound: 20 custom functions, and 31 personal functions.\n\nAccessories marketed simultaneously with the EOS-1V include the EOS Link Software (ES-E1); and two items expanding macro system capabilities: the EF 100mm f/2.8 USM MACRO lens and the Macro Ring Lite MR-14EX.",

While retaining the basic features and design concept of the Luna series, it improves the features and simplifies operation.\n\nBy employing two aspherical elements, the lens is a high-magnification 3.2X (28-90mm) wide-angle zoom lens, yet it is installed in a compact, full-flat body that is smaller than the Autoboy Luna XL that only has a 2.5X zoom lens. The compact full-flat design, sliding lens cover, advanced molding techniques and full silver coating produce a fashionable high-quality image. Operation is improved by grouping the large Best Shot Dial, incorporating the main switch and exposure mode settings, and LCD panel on the back cover; and by adding an eyesight adjustment capability to the eyepiece.",

      "description": "The Canon EOS 7 will appeal to a broad spectrum of users in the middle of the EOS lineup, from serious amateurs to people stepping up from entry-level EOS models.\n\nWith Canon’s unique CMOS imaging sensor, the EOS 7 has 7-point wide-area autofocus allowing compositional freedom regardless of subject position. Compared with the professional EOS-3, the response time of eye movement detection for AF frame selection is reduced by about 15%. For manual selection, focusing point arrow keys on the back cover’s quick control dial allow quick and intuitive selection of the focusing point. Additionally, the EOS 7 is the first EOS with eye control and superimposed (SI) focusing point display to incorporate eyesight-correcting dioptric adjustment in the same camera, giving it a most refined viewfinder.\n\nIt has 4fps high-speed motor drive, and AI Servo predictive AF on a par with the flagship EOS-1V. The latest silencing technology greatly reduce film winding and rewinding noise allowing photography and film replacement in quiet places without fear of disturbing others.\n\nThe design makes the best of Canon’s cutting-edge molding technologies and meticulous finishing of the body, and the sculptured top and front covers made of rigid black anodized aluminum result in the refined, innovative, high quality image, Even given the quite compact body dimensions, the shape and layout of the grip, shutter button and electronic dial result in excellent handling and functionality.\n\nThe evaluative metering 35-zone sensor linked to the active focusing point combined with the Speedlite EX series E-TTL autoflash system and 13 custom functions complete a most comprehensive list of functions.",

With its 2.7x zoom lens and very high cost performance resulting in a reasonable price, the IXY 230 is the high quality IX 240 compact camera.\n\nThe 2.7x zoom 24-65mm (135 format equivalent: 30-81mm) lens effectively corrects for various aberrations and gives high contrast by optimally placing the aspherical lens element resulting in excellent image quality throughout the zoom range.\n\nThe extremely compact, lightweight body continues the basic “box and circle” design concept resulting in a dignified, yet casual new generation design. The large, bright, clear viewfinder and large display panel make operation simple and easy.\n\nThe IXY 230 has a full compliment of fine Advanced Photo System features: Mid-roll rewind and cartridge replacement (MRC), three different custom functions, six shooting parameters recorded for improved print quality (PQI), a selection of three different “print types” (formats), date and title printing, and specification of the desired number of prints.",

      "description": "The Canon Autoboy LUNA 105 S, developed as the successor to the Autoboy LUNA 105, launched in June 1997, realizes exceptionally high cost performance, effectively balancing the benefits of high functionality, refined design and outstanding operability at a low suggested retail price.\n\nThe camera’s high-performance 2.8x (38-105mm) zoom lens incorporates two aspherical lens elements that effectively correct for a variety of lens aberrations to deliver sharp imaging performance throughout the entire zoom range. Furthermore, the Autoboy LUNA 105 S’s 3-point AiAF focusing enables the camera to accurately identify the main subject, even when it does not appear in the center of the viewfinder, while the slide-out Light Guide Flash helps reduce the occurrence of red-eye when shooting in the telephoto range. These features enable users to easily achieve consistently high-quality results.\n\nOther advanced features include manual +/-1.5-step exposure compensation, center 1-point AF, to ensure accurate focus on the intended subject, and RT (Real Time) Release, which enables users to capture the best moment in any shooting situation with virtually real-time exposures.\n\nThe body of the new Canon compact camera features a stylish white-gold and neutral-titanium two-tone front-face design and a thin metallic ring around the lens unit provides a refined accent.",

      "description": "The Canon IXY i represents the third generation of the IXY camera series , ushered in a new era in Advanced Photo System compact camera design with its innovative “box-and-circle” design and ultra-compact “card-size” body.\n\nThe IXY i departs from its predecessors with a sleek new-generation design that contrasts a soft, rounded aluminum body casing with chrome-plated fittings. The rugged but lightweight new unit also features an innovative capsule-shaped body with a slim-line 2:1 aspect ratio for exceeding portability and eye-catching appeal, and incorporates for the first time a tidy sliding lens cover that protects the lens from scratching.\n\nThe IXY i features a 23.5-54mm 2.3x zoom lens, equivalent to a 29-68mm zoom lens on a 35mm camera, enabling superior performance in a wide variety of shooting environments. Canon has also incorporated the world’s first combined AF/AE (Auto-Focus/Auto-Exposure) CMOS sensor in its passive 3-point AiAF (Artificial intelligence Automatic Focusing) system.\n\nUser convenience and camera functionality are enhanced by a large LCD operating display panel located on the back of the unit that is backlit for easy operation even in low-light conditions.",

Even with its high image quality 3.4X zoom lens, it has the most compact body in its class, when marketed. The soft curved lines and surfaces of the exterior and the effective use of two-tone silver and silver blue coloring effectively emphasize the feeling of compactness. Moreover, the front cover’s aluminum finish and the stainless steel ring at the front of the lens barrel exude a feeling of quality.\n\nFeature-wise, the combined AF/AE CMOS sensor provides both precise exposure control and accurate autofocus (passive 3-point AiAF) linked to the zoom and AF points over the entire range. There are five custom functions including continuous shooting mode, as well as eyesight correction, manual exposure compensation, and user-friendly control layout that make the camera simple and easy to use.",

Featuring a high-speed-processing microcomputer and new algorithms, the camera achieves an AF speed equal to that of the class-leading EOS Kiss 5 as well as exceeding predictive AF performance for more stable consecutive shooting of moving objects.\n\nKey performance features inherited from the EOS Kiss 5 include a 7-point wide-area AF system with five focusing points arranged horizontally within the viewfinder and one each above and below the center point. The system ensures accurate AF performance with unrestricted framing, regardless of the position of the subject within the viewfinder.\n\nThe EOS Kiss Lite also utilizes an enhanced 35-zone evaluative metering sensor linked to each focusing point. Featuring a vastly improved metering algorithm, the sensor analyzes and makes adjustments for lighting conditions around the subject to ensure ideal exposure every time.\n\nContinuing to redefine the image of SLR cameras, the new EOS Kiss Lite’s cutting-edge design features a metallic-gray exterior finish that conveys an understated elegance. The model’s ergonomically designed handgrip is overlain with a black-rubber coating for enhanced handheld comfort and operability as well as a rugged appearance. The camera also realizes a compact lightweight body measuring 130 x 88 x 64 mm and weighing just 340 grams, the lightest in the EOS Kiss series. In addition to compact proportions, the EOS Kiss Lite offers an easy-operation layout with a large-size (22.4 x 30.0 mm) LCD data panel on the back of the camera, and groups all main operating controls together on the right-hand side to enable one-handed control of most functions.",

      "description": "The new Canon EOS 7s is based on the EOS 7 released in October 2000 and offers improved functionality to satisfy a wide range of users, from photo enthusiasts looking for something beyond an entry-level model to high-end amateur photographers.\n\nFeaturing a high-speed-processing microcomputer and employing a new AF sequence (equivalent to that of the EOS 10D digital AF SLR camera), the EOS 7s realizes the fastest one-shot AF performance in its class*. The camera also features Canon’s new E-TTL II automatic flash exposure control. Used with Canon’s EX-series Speedlite flashes, ETTL II employs a revised metering algorithm that utilizes distance information received via Canon EF lenses for exposure control with improved precision and stability.\n\nEnhancing operability, the EOS 7s has a backlit operation-display panel, large printed control markings on the body for easy recognition, and intuitive, user-friendly control placement. The model also raises the bar aesthetically, offering a sophisticated-looking body with aluminum front and top covers finished with bonded black alumite and a leather-tone Ultra-Mat Coating. Adding to the camera’s refined appearance is a stylish metal mode dial, embossed with raised electroplating for a three-dimensional effect.\n\nThe EOS 7s features the same outstanding eye-controlled 7-point wide area AF system employed in the EOS 7, providing users with greater framing flexibility, regardless of the location of the subject within the viewfinder. The eye-control function realizes a reduction in response time of approximately 15% compared with the high-end EOS-3, distinguishing the model as the fastest eye-controlled camera in the EOS series. Other performance enhancing features include built-in dioptric adjustment and focusing points superimposed in the viewfinder.\n\nIn addition to a continuous-shooting speed of 4 fps, the EOS 7s boasts predictive AF performance equivalent to Canon’s flagship 35mm AF SLR-model EOS-1V, enabling the camera to maintain focus on a moving subject by continuously tracking its movement. Moreover, 35-zone evaluative metering, which is linked to each focusing point, analyzes and makes adjustments for lighting conditions around the subject to ensure outstanding exposure performance.\n\nThe EOS 7s permits users to shoot and change film even in situations requiring silence, incorporating a transport system that features a state-of-the-art noise-reduction design to ensure exceptionally quiet performance during film advance and film rewind.",

      "description": "Canon’s advanced new Autoboy N150, featuring a high-quality 38-50mm 4x zoom lens, joins the popular Autoboy camera lineup one rank above the Autoboy N130 core model, released in August 2002. The N150’s powerful zoom lens incorporates two aspherical lens elements, which effectively correct for spherical aberration to ensure exceptional imaging performance throughout the zoom range. Moreover, while offering a high zoom ratio, the new camera utilizes space-saving technology, including a compact three-stage retractable lens and an ultra-compact light-guide flash, to realize the smallest body in its class, measuring just 107 (w) x 58.7 (h) x 51.5 mm (d). The new Autoboy N150’s design, featuring a two-tone silver color scheme, incorporates soft curved lines and surfaces to enhance the unit’s compact appearance. Moreover, a translucent-plastic accent on the handgrip, and metallic fittings on the lens barrel add a refined elegance befitting a high-end Autoboy-series model.\n\nCanon’s new compact camera incorporates a combined AF/AE (Auto-Focus/Auto-Exposure) CMOS sensor in its passive 3-point AiAF (Artificial intelligence Automatic Focusing) system. By linking focusing and exposure control to the zoom and focusing points, the AF/AE CMOS sensor makes possible finer exposure control and precise focus performance, while passive 3-point AiAF focusing enables the camera to accurately identify the main subject, even when it does not appear in the center of the frame.\n\nOther advanced features include a selection of six “Best Shot Modes,” including Auto, Action and Night Portrait, to cater to a wide range of shooting conditions; and five settable Custom Functions to suit almost any shooting objective. Custom Functions include a continuous-shooting setting that enables a shooting speed of 0.7 frames per second, and Real-Time Release, which enables virtually real-time exposures to ensure that no shooting opportunity is missed. Other features such as manual exposure compensation of +/-1.5EV, dioptric adjustment from +0.5 to -2.5 diopter, and easy-to-use control button placement contribute to user convenience and enjoyment. The Canon Autoboy N150 (including case and wrist strap) will go on sale in Japan in late May at an open price. Canon has set initial production at 30,000 units per month.",

      "description": "The Canon EOS Kiss 7 is the latest addition to the company’s best-selling EOS Kiss series of affordable AF SLR film cameras. Featuring a high-speed-processing microcomputer and new algorithms, the EOS Kiss 7 achieves the fastest AF speed in its class*. Moreover, the new camera’s revised predictive AF sequence for shooting moving objects enables class-leading* continuous shooting performance of 2.5 frames per second (fps) in AI Servo AF mode, while a revised film advance mechanism boosts film-winding speed for three fps shooting in One-Shot AF mode.\n\nThe EOS Kiss 7 offers 7-point wide-area autofocus – five focusing points arranged horizontally within the viewfinder and one each above and below the center point – ensuring accurate autofocus performance with unrestricted framing, regardless of the position of the subject within the viewfinder. The model also utilizes an enhanced 35-zone evaluative metering sensor linked to each focusing point to deliver ideal exposure every time. Moreover, a maximum shutter speed of 1/4000 second and an increased X-sync speed of 1/125 second permits users a wide range of creative possibilities that are usually beyond this camera class.\n\nThe EOS Kiss 7 offers a Guide No. 13 (at ISO 100 in m) built-in flash unit for increased photographic freedom compared with the Kiss 5 predecessor model, which featured a Guide No. 12 flash. Furthermore, the camera’s E-TTL II (Evaluative Through-The-Lens) autoflash system, which operates with the built-in flash as well as EX-series Speedlite flash units, utilizes distance information provided by Canon EF lenses to achieve natural balance between subject and background.\n\nThe compact (130 x 90 x 64 mm), lightweight (365 g) EOS Kiss 7 builds on the innovative design characteristics of the Kiss 5. Featuring an ergonomic handgrip clad in black rubber for enhanced holding comfort, the Kiss 7 exudes sophistication with a dark metallic body color and new materials. Also, a “cross key” control pad has been added to make such operations as selecting the AF point easy, and all main operating controls have been grouped together on the handgrip side of the camera to enable the operation of most functions with one hand.\n\nThe rear panel of the EOS Kiss 7 incorporates a large-size (30 x 30 mm) information display with backlight, enabling camera settings to be seen clearly even in dark conditions. And, for the first time in the Kiss series, the camera offers a range of Custom Functions, including six shooting settings and safety features such as a shutter release lock, which prevents shooting when there is no film in the camera or if no lens is attached, and a warning beeper which alerts users to the possibility of handshake as a result of the shutter speed setting.",

      "description": "The Autoboy N130 II, developed as a core model in Canon’s Autoboy-series compact camera lineup, features a 38–130mm 3.4x zoom lens and, measuring 107 (w) x 59 (h) x 44.5 mm (d), a body size among the smallest in its class.\n\nThe body design of the new Autoboy incorporates two distinct sections, conveying a highly distinctive look while realizing a compact size. Chrome plating on the grip and around the lens barrel, along with diamond-cut cross-hatching on the end of the lens barrel, add an air of elegant sophistication.\n\nTo ensure consistently accurate auto-focus operation under any shooting conditions, the Autoboy N130 II features a passive 3-point AiAF (Artificial intelligence Automatic Focusing) system incorporating an integrated AF/AE (Auto-Focus/Auto-Exposure) CMOS sensor unit. The system works in tandem with the zoom settings and AF points to make possible precise exposure control and accurate auto-focusing performance.\n\nThe camera includes a newly introduced audio alert system with four types of tones, which notifies users that a subject is in focus, provides a camera-shake warning, announces setting confirmations, and sounds a self-timer signal.\n\nThe Autoboy N130 II offers a selection of six Best Shot Modes optimized for a wide variety of shooting situations and five Custom Functions to match individual user preferences. Other features contributing to operating ease include built-in dioptric adjustment, an exposure compensation function when shooting in backlit conditions, and a user-friendly control button layout.",

      "description": "For twenty years since the Hansa Canon, film-loading was through the camera bottom (like old Leicas). The VT was Canon’s first camera to have a camera back which swung open for film loading. Since it was the successor to the IV-series, the designation included a “V.” However, it had a totally new concept with a built-in self-timer, a different three-mode viewfinder, and a winding trigger. The viewfinder magnification could be set to suit a wide-angle 35mm lens. The half-mirror prism had a highly-reflective gold finish, making the viewfinder 2.5 times brighter than before. The film advanced with a fast-winding trigger at the camera bottom instead of a knob on top. This set it apart from the other cameras. The “T” in “VT” was for “Trigger.”",

It was a fine lens line-up for Japan’s only high-end 35mm camera. The frame counter was on the camera top at the base of the film advance knob. On the Hansa Canon, it was on the camera front. This was to make room for the slow shutter speed governor. Due to internal mechanism changes, the top cover consisted of two parts with one part covering the protruding viewfinder portion. This was unlike the single-piece top cover of the Hansa Canon. The slow shutter speed dial was lever-controlled for easier operation.",

      "description": "The top-class 35mm camera market gradually shifted from rangefinder cameras to single-lens reflex cameras. The major reason was that SLRs could handle close-ups, photomicrography, duplication work, and other applications without being constrained by the limits of rangefinder camera lenses. When Canon introduced the Canonflex, its first SLR, there were already eight SLR models on the market.\n\nThe Canonflex used a high-quality, breechlock lens mount. The lens flange ring was turned to lock the lens onto the camera flange’s bayonet lugs. The lens flange and camera flange did not rub against each other like today’s lens mounts. The camera used Super-Canomatic lenses which had a fast, fully-automatic diaphragm. A 130-degree winding trigger at the camera bottom enabled quick film advance. An external selenium exposure meter could also be attached.",

A built-in exposure meter was deemed as essential for taking good pictures.",

      "description": "The Olympus-Pen in September 1959 was the first camera in Japan to offer the half-frame format which doubled the number of exposures on a roll of 35mm film. Canon had also started development of a compact and luxury-looking half-frame camera.\nThe resulting Canon Demi offered high-performance features in a pocket-size package. They included a direct viewfinder, a 28mm f/2.8 lens (5 elements in 3 groups), and a match-needle selenium exposure meter which used a behind-the-lens light value program for accurate metering. When the Demi was introduced, there were already twelve competing models in the market. The Demi, however, proved to be popular. “Demi” comes from the French word meaning “half.”",

To counter this and to respond to the European subsidiary’s desire for such a camera, the Canonex was developed. It was Canon’s first and last Lens-Shutter SLR camera.\n\nThe main features were shutter speed-priority EE with a built-in selenium exposure meter, an aperture scale and match needle in the viewfinder, and a metering and exposure window having an exposure warning zone.\n\nWith conventional Lens-Shutter SLR cameras, the light entering the camera through the eyepiece during the exposure was blocked by a blinding curtain behind the mirror. However, since the Canonex’s mirror also functioned as a blinding curtain, there was no separate blinding curtain.",

Other details and the original price are unknown. Around 1939, Seiki-Kogaku was starting to make its own lenses. It made a prototype, Tessar-type 50mm f/4.5 lens (4 elements in 3 groups) and Sonnar-type 135mm f/4 lens (4 elements in 3 groups) without a rangefinder coupling. “Serenar” was chosen from among in-company suggestions for the name of the lenses. The name is probably based on the name of a sea on the moon.\n\nIt was not until 1947 when the company started making usable lenses for its cameras.",

      "description": "The first of a new Canonet series developed for compactness and lighter weight.\nThe camera was about 20 mm narrower, 4 mm shorter, and 30 percent lighter than the previous Canonet. To make it more compact, the lens focal length was shortened to 40mm, resulting in a wider angle lens. A Speedlite (Canolite D) which did away with complicated Guide No. calculations was also introduced. The flash aperture was set automatically to suit the flash output and subject distance. This was the fully-automatic flash system called CATS (Canon Auto Tuning System) incorporated for the first time.\n\nWith this feature, picture-taking with EE was completely automatic for both night and day.\n\nNew Canonet QL17-L(released in June 1970) was an improved version of the New Canonet QL17, this camera’s viewfinder had a battery check zone near the f/5.6 mark. By pressing the battery check button, you could check the battery level in the viewfinder. Other specifications and features were the same as the New Canonet QL17. “L” was for Luxury.",

      "description": "Records show that only about 100 Canon S 1 cameras were made. It is likely that the parts stocked before and during the war were used to make these cameras. When Japan’s wartime devastation got worse, military supplier Seiki-Kogaku was evacuated to Yamanashi Prefecture. Peace came only when Japan lost the war. After the war ended, Seiki-Kogaku had no means to transport its factory machinery from Yamanashi to Tokyo. A camera-loving U.S. commanding officer of a communications unit stationed in Yokohama heard about this and had military trucks transport the factory equipment to the company’s main factory in Meguro, Tokyo. In appreciation, the company made and presented a Canon S I to that officer.",

The viewfinder had bright frame lines with automatic parallax correction. It showed the necessary picture-taking information and a double-image superimposing rangefinder was built-in. Despite these sophisticated features, the camera had an entry-level price. A long-seller, the camera was manufactured until 1976.",

The S II was probably so named because it was the successor to the camera which later came to be called the Canon S. It was the first new model after the war. The non-universal, threaded lens mount was identical to the Canon J’s. The viewfinder and coupled rangefinder were combined into a single window. During the post-war food shortage, Japan received various relief supplies from the Allied Powers. As collateral for these supplies, cameras were sold through occupation personnel exchanges. In effect, it was the company’s first export camera and it drew attention.\nConsequently, it became a national policy to favor the company for the procurement of metals, lens glass, electricity, fuel, etc. In September 1947, the corporate name was changed to “Canon Camera Company Ltd.”",

They were expensive and produced in small numbers.\n\nThe AE-1, however, was designed from the ground up with five major units and twenty-five minor units. They were centrally controlled by a microcomputer. By incorporating electronics, the parts count could be reduced by 300. The manufacturing of the camera was also highly automated.

      "description": "The RC-250, known as the Q-PIC, was designed to make electronic photography   simple, fun, and affordable. It was an easy-to-use, compact, lightweight,   all-in-one recording and playback still video camera, with excellent handling   and operation. The designers produced a smart, leading edge design while   breaking the 100,000-yen barrier.\nThe 786 pixel (horizontal) CCD image   sensor, Electronic Still Camera Standardization Committee optional “Hi-band”   specification, ultra-compact integral flash and “intelligent auto white balance”   giving excellent color regardless of lighting made full color electronic   photography as easy and affordable as contemporary 35mm compact cameras.\nWith its built-in playback capacity, the RC-250 could be instantly connected to any television to view the images.",
